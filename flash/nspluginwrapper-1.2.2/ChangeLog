	* NEWS, src/npw-malloc.c, src/npw-malloc.h, src/npw-viewer.c:
	  Backport from trunk:
	  
	  Make sure NPWindow::ws_info points to a unique location for the
	  lifetime of the window. This fixes support for the VLC plugin
	  that makes a local copy of NPWindow but doesn't bother about
	  making an NPWindow::ws_info copy.

2008-12-26 23:37  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* NEWS: Updates with "hot" fixes.

2008-12-26 23:33  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Backport from trunk:
	  
	  Fix NPN_GetStringIdentifiers() to free identifiers with
	  NPW_MemFree().
	* src/npw-player.c: Backport from trunk:
	  
	  Fix stream_new() to return NULL if an error occurred.

2008-12-26 13:42  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* nspluginwrapper.spec: Bump release for development.

2008-12-21 14:02  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Destroy the plugin window in NPP_Destroy().
	  NPAPI docs mention plugin shall not use graphics operations
	  beyond that call. So, don't bother with broken plugins, we
	  already have our own bugs to bother with...

2008-12-21 12:14  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* .: Create nspluginwrapper-1.2-branch from rev 837.

2008-12-20 21:32  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* gwenole/projects/nspluginwrapper/trunk/src/npw-config.c:
	  Suppress error messages in non-verbose mode when exec()'ing
	  npviewer.bin (Stanislav Brabec).

2008-12-20 22:22  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* NEWS, nspluginwrapper.spec: 1.2.0.

2008-12-20 21:32  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-config.c: Suppress error messages in non-verbose mode

2008-12-20 21:16  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-config.c: Remove non-strictly conforming usage of
	  varargs (noticed by Carsten Juttner).

2008-12-16 22:48  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* configure: Newer Intel compilers deprecated use of -c99. Rather,
	  they now support the GCC-like option -std=c99.

2008-12-16 22:45  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* tests/test-rpc-nested-2.c: Fix return values.

2008-12-14 22:08  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Drop beta status.

	* NEWS, nspluginwrapper.spec: Updates for 1.2.0.

2008-12-14 21:58  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* ChangeLog: Generated by svn2cl.

2008-12-14 21:40  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/utils.c: Handle unmasked variants of NPNVariable and
	  NPPVariable.

2008-12-14 21:39  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-common.h, src/npw-viewer.c: Handle NPNVToolkit variable
	  regardless of the C++ ABI mask flag if we implement Gtk2. This
	  fixes Flash Player 10 plugin (built with Sun Studio) execution
	  with a gcc built npviewer.bin since NPNVToolkit has a different
	  value in that case.

2008-12-14 21:22  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Load the SunStudio C++ run-time library on
	  Solaris. This is necessary for the Flash Player 10 plugin.

2008-12-14 20:42  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile, nspluginwrapper.spec: No longer ship with obsolete
	  mkruntime script. It was never really used anyway.

2008-12-14 18:09  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-player.c: Fix definition of byte array, aka Stun Studio
	  warning fix.

2008-12-14 18:02  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-common.h: Avoid warning for empty member declaration
	  (Sun Studio), i.e. avoid double-colon.

2008-12-14 18:01  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime.c: Fix incomplete assert(), noticed by David
	  Binderman.

2008-12-14 17:58  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Fix variable used in comparison.

2008-12-14 17:56  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* npapi/npapi.h: Remove extraneous characters.
	* npapi/nptypes.h: Fix build on newer Solaris distributions. bool
	  is defined as a macro by the ISO C standard.

2008-12-14 17:54  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* npapi/nspr/prcpucfg.h: Add definitions for Solaris builds with
	  Sun Studio compilers.

2008-12-14 17:53  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* configure: Recognize Sun Studio compilers.

2008-12-14 17:26  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* tests/test-rpc-types.c: Fix RPC test with 0 argument.

2008-12-14 10:29  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Implement
	  PluginInstance::invalidate() vfunc. Besides, don't free() the
	  NPP instance in NPP_Destroy() because the plugin may still use
	  it through an NPObject::Invalidate() vfunc for example.

2008-12-14 10:23  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-common.c, src/npw-common.h, src/npw-rpc.c: Add
	  NPW_PluginInstance::invalidate() vfunc akin to NPObjects.

2008-12-14 10:21  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime.c: Reset hashes to NULL after they were destroyed.

2008-12-14 09:39  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.sh: Allow use of valgrind if NPW_USE_VALGRIND is
	  set to "yes". Use NPW_VALGRIND_OPTIONS to pass additional
	  options to valgrind.

2008-12-14 09:15  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/rpc.c: Fix debug message.

2008-12-13 14:06  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* configure: Allow biarch builds on Linux platforms only.

2008-12-13 14:05  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/utils.c: Fix build on FreeBSD (and others) since
	  /proc/self/fd is a Linux-only extension.

2008-12-10 21:10  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Flush the X output buffer while destroying the
	  plugin window. i.e. make sure we have no pending callback that
	  would depend on that dead window.

2008-12-10 20:52  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* nspluginwrapper.spec: Bump version for development.

2008-12-07 22:53  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* NEWS, nspluginwrapper.spec: Updates for 1.1.10 (1.2.0-RC).

2008-12-07 22:44  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* ChangeLog: Generated by svn2cl.

2008-12-07 22:35  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Destroy plugin window only if PluginInstance
	  is finalize'd. This is because an NPPVpluginScriptableNPObject
	  can still hold a reference to it (and a call to
	  NPClass::Invalidate() would fail in that case).

2008-12-07 22:30  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime-impl.h, src/npruntime.c: Use NPW memory allocator
	  for NPObjectInfo objects. Reference count PluginInstance bound
	  to an NPObject if it is known at NPClass::allocate() time.

2008-12-07 22:02  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Re-add refcount debugging
	  info for NPN_{Create,Retain,Release}Object().

2008-12-07 21:48  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Remove delayed NPN_InvalidateRect() code as
	  it's no longer necessary with RPC synchronous messaging.

2008-12-07 19:25  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Make NPN_ReleaseObject() use
	  rpc_method_invoke_possible() to check whether we can send it
	  immediately. This detects the case where a call is made after
	  rpc_method_send_reply() but before we return from the
	  rpc_dispatch() handler.

2008-12-07 19:22  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/rpc.c, src/rpc.h: Implement synchronous messaging. aka turns
	  an async call (i.e. an rpc_method_invoke() with a connection in
	  server mode) into a synchronous one. That way, the browser is
	  notified that the plugin wants to make a call and then puts self
	  into condition to receive the message (normal rpc_dispatch() or
	  at the end of a toplevel NPP_*() function).
	  
	  This makes it RPC protocol v2.6.

2008-12-07 15:30  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* tests/test-rpc-concurrent.c: Improve concurrent test to check we
	  get the right answers (in case nested handling got wrong).
	  Besides, make sure the client waits for all server's incoming
	  calls prior to rpc_test_exit()'ing.

2008-12-07 15:24  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* tests/test-rpc-common.c: Make sure to handle RPC on both ends,
	  including the client's side.

2008-12-07 08:12  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Fix NPP_HandleEvent() return value on error.

2008-12-07 08:10  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime.c, src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Add checks
	  for all rpc_method_invoke() functions.

2008-12-07 08:06  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/debug.h: Add npw_return_if_fail() and
	  npw_return_val_if_fail() helpers.

2008-12-07 07:16  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/rpc.c, src/rpc.h, tests/test-rpc-nested-2.c: Add
	  rpc_method_invoke_possible() interface to check whether we are
	  ready to call rpc_method_invoke() or not. i.e. in particular, if
	  we are not trying to invoke functions after
	  rpc_method_send_reply() and before we return from an RPC method
	  handler.

2008-12-06 18:21  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* tests/test-rpc-common.c, tests/test-rpc-concurrent.c,
	  tests/test-rpc-nested-1.c, tests/test-rpc-types.c: Use helpers.
	  In particular, don't use g_assert() but rather RPC_TEST_ENSURE()
	  or RPC_TEST_ENSURE_NO_ERROR() which always evaluate.

2008-12-06 18:13  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile, tests/test-rpc-nested-2.c: Add another testcase for
	  nested rpc_method_invoke(). This time, we are also emitting a
	  call just after an rpc_method_send_reply(). Note: this is not
	  fixed yet.

2008-12-06 18:11  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* tests/test-rpc-common.h: Add helpers.

2008-12-06 18:10  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile, tests/test-rpc-nested-1.c, tests/test-rpc-nested.c:
	  Rename.

2008-12-06 09:08  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Rework the XEMBED hack. Don't let the browser
	  cause Gtk to kill our window. i.e. don't process WM_DELETE_EVENT
	  sent by the browser GtkSocket. That way, we will kill the window
	  ourselves in NPP_Destroy().

2008-12-04 21:31  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Process delayed calls in NPP_Destroy() only if
	  PluginInstances match. Besides, don't care about pending
	  NPN_InvalidateRect() requests if we already know the instance
	  will pass away soon (i.e. we are in NPP_Destroy()).

2008-12-03 22:56  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Delay all NPN_InvalidateRect() messages. An
	  intermediate solution may be to delay the messages only if there
	  is actually incoming RPC. Postpone this optimization for a
	  future version (and smarter strategy to "compress" the
	  region/requests).

2008-12-03 20:51  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime-impl.h, src/npruntime.c: Add debug messages for
	  NPClass::invoke_*() functions.

2008-12-02 21:49  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Fix invalid RPC beyond
	  NPP_Destroy(). This fixes the following scenario:
	  
	  Browser: NPP_Destroy()
	  -> rpc_method_invoke()
	  Viewer: NPN_InvalidateRect()
	  -> rpc_method_invoke()
	  -> rpc_dispatch() pending messages
	  -> handle_NPP_Destroy()
	  -> PluginInstance is killed
	  -> send PluginInstance but it was killed...
	  
	  Now, with the help of reference counting, we can hold the
	  PluginInstance. Besides, NPP_Destroy() will reset instance_id,
	  thus RPC won't be sending a "valid" PluginInstance to the other
	  side, thus reducing the other side call to a no-op. i.e. don't
	  try to do anything with the browser NPP instance that was killed
	  previously (the NPP_Destroy() call would have completed by the
	  time the browser-side needs to handle incoming RPC).

2008-12-02 21:00  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Preserve PluginInstance objects during
	  invoke_NPN_*() function calls. This is because
	  rpc_method_invoke() can handle pending messages, among which an
	  NPP_Destroy() is possible. Since the latter unref the
	  PluginInstance, we could arrive in a situation where we are
	  dereferencing deallocated data.

2008-12-02 20:44  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-common.h, src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Replace
	  all RPC_TYPE_NPP with RPC_TYPE_NPW_PLUGIN_INSTANCE.

2008-12-02 20:15  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-rpc.c, src/npw-rpc.h: Add RPC_TYPE_NPW_PLUGIN_INSTANCE
	  to marshal PluginInstance objects.

2008-12-01 23:01  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Pass PluginInstance to invoke_NP*() functions.
	  The next step is to replace RPC_TYPE_NPP with
	  RPC_TYPE_NPW_PLUGIN_INSTANCE.

2008-12-01 21:55  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Minor cleanups. Make sure
	  plugin->instance is NULL on exit from NPP_Destroy().

2008-12-01 21:47  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-common.h: Remove extraneous "extern" linkage keyword,
	  this is default behaviour.

2008-12-01 21:46  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-common.c, src/npw-common.h, src/npw-viewer.c,
	  src/npw-wrapper.c: Add infrastructure to refcount PlugInstances.

2008-12-01 20:28  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* configure, src/npruntime.c, src/npw-viewer.c: Disable PID check,
	  this is not really useful unless a plugin does fork() without
	  exec(). This could be reactivated with --enable-pid-check though.

2008-12-01 20:06  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Fix pid_check() for USE_PID_CHECK == 0 (thanks
	  Martin Stransky).

2008-12-01 20:03  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* nspluginwrapper.spec: Bump release for development.

2008-11-30 23:03  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* ChangeLog: Generated by svn2cl.

2008-11-30 23:00  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Drop use of "extern inline" as some (older)
	  compilers don't support ISO C semantics.

2008-11-30 22:54  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* NEWS, nspluginwrapper.spec: Updates for 1.1.8.

2008-11-30 22:39  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Process all pending calls in NPP_Destroy() as
	  the data could become junk afterwards.

2008-11-30 22:34  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Don't delay call to NPN_ReleaseObject() if we
	  can handle it now.

2008-11-30 21:52  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/rpc.c: Add rpc_method_*_valist() variants, internal only for
	  now.

2008-11-30 21:24  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Slightly improved delayed call mechanism. This
	  is not fully satisfying yet as I believe a pipe should be better
	  (glib GSource creation is slow). Fortunately, there doesn't seem
	  to be that many calls to NPN_ReleaseObject().

2008-11-30 21:07  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-malloc.h: Fix typo.

2008-11-30 20:47  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime.c, src/npw-viewer.c: Delay calls to
	  NPN_ReleaseObject. Revert:
	  
	  2008-11-22 10:43 Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>
	  
	  * src/npw-wrapper.c: Fix NPN_ReleaseObject() reply, i.e. don't
	  dereference npobj after the real call to NPN handler as it could
	  be deallocated.

2008-11-30 17:38  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime.c, src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Add
	  missing debugging messages.

2008-11-30 17:21  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime.c: Fix pid_check() for the browser-side
	  implementation.

2008-11-30 17:14  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime.c, src/npw-viewer.c: Extend PID check to npruntime
	  bridge.

2008-11-30 15:52  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* lsb-build/stub_libs/libc_main.c: Add dirfd() for
	  npw_close_all_open_files().

2008-11-30 15:47  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Check that processes fork()'ed off
	  npviewer.bin don't issue RPC calls. Initial patch by Martin
	  Stransky.

2008-11-30 14:56  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime.c: Rename is_npclass_valid() to
	  is_valid_npobject_class().

2008-11-30 14:50  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Remove wrong comment. The
	  errors previously noticed were due to the fact that NPObjects
	  were looked up in the wrong (previously deallocated) hash table.
	  We now preserve that hash table.

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Likewise for npobject_bridge_destroy().

2008-11-30 14:18  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Move id_init() into NP_Initialize(), likewise
	  for id_kill() into NP_Shutdown(). Those functions are guaranteed
	  to be called only once. g_NP_Initialize() and g_NP_Shutdown()
	  could be called several times for the restart machinery but we
	  don't want to clobber with IDs generated previously.

2008-11-30 13:17  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Kill viewer if the parent browser died (Martin

2008-11-30 13:08  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Use

	  connection loss (Martin Stransky). In that case, all NPObjects
	  are invalidated. XXX: this is too global.

2008-11-30 12:10  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime-impl.h, src/npruntime.c: Add a mechanism to stop

2008-11-25 22:11  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.sh: Make `which' failures silent for

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Update NPP_Write() comment for negative array
	  lengths.

2008-11-09 16:56  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Propagate NPP_Write() with negative lengths
	  since the plugin may want to handle that case (e.g. close a
	  stream?). In practise, this doesn't make much sense either.
	  NPAPI specs need to be updated to mean "close the stream" if
	  NPP_WriteReady() returns a negative value.

2008-11-09 16:46  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/rpc.c, tests/test-rpc-types.c: Actually, since an array of
	  negative size doesn't make sense, let it be the responsibility
	  of the caller to check for bounds.

2008-11-09 16:38  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/rpc.c, tests/test-rpc-types.c: Size of the array to
	  RPC_TYPE_ARRAY argument is now an int32. Allow for NULL arrays
	  or arrays of negative length. In that case, the returned array
	  pointer in the other size is NULL.

2008-11-09 15:26  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

2008-11-06 22:06  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* configure: Build glib memory hooks only if system glib supports
	  g_slice_alloc().

2008-11-04 23:16  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime.c, src/npw-common.c, src/npw-rpc.c,
	  src/npw-wrapper.c: Fix remaining memory leaks in npruntime
	  bridge.
	  
	  The strategy with NPVariants assumes that NPObject methods will
	  preserve the NPVariant value by copying it (e.g. a string) or
	  increasing the refcount of the underlying NPObject. IOW, they
	  don't assume the value is live beyond the call to that method
	  without preserving it.
	  
	  Based on this assumption, we can write the following rules:
	  - Any NPVariant value shall be released if it comes from an
	  rpc_method_get_args(). That's an nspluginwrapper requirement
	  - Any NPVariant result value shall be released when the plugin
	  no longer needs it. That's an NPAPI requirement, implemented by
	  the plugin.
	  
	  Thus, we deal with NPObjects as follows:
	  - Prior to sending an NPObject (in an NPVariant), the browser
	  ref()'s it
	  - After having received an NPObject, the browser ref()'s it i.e.
	  since this is a browser-side object, it's browser side
	  responsibility to ref()' the object.
	  
	  The plugin will unref() the NPObject "naturally" when (i) the
	  NPVariant got from rpc_method_get_args() is released, or (ii)
	  the NPVariant is explicitly unref()'ed per NPAPI specs for
	  NPVariant result values.

2008-11-04 21:21  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-malloc.c: Fix copy-paste error.

2008-11-03 23:04  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Don't try to NPP_Write() erroneous buffers of
	  supposedly negative length.
	  
	  Actually, we can get to that case if NPP_WriteReady() returned
	  -1 or another negative value, in general. Some browsers
	  (Konqueror, Google Chrome) send data through NPP_Write() anyway.
	  Others (Firefox, WebKit) actually suspend the stream temporarily.
	  
	  Note that returning -1 here will destroy the stream. This is
	  compatible with the expected behaviour. e.g. the DiamondX test
	  plugin wants that. Is there any other "real" plugin in that case
	  too?

2008-11-03 22:29  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Use the XEMBED hack (GTK_WINDOW_POPUP toplevel
	  widget instead of GtkPlug) only with Gtk2-based browsers. IOW,
	  this restores the older behaviour for Konqueror as this causes
	  problems there.

2008-11-03 22:20  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-rpc.c: Fix NPN_GetValue() with NPNVToolkit.
	  
	  Actually, it was not a problem before because we used to always
	  return NPNVGtk2. However, we now want to detect what toolkit the
	  parent browser is using.

2008-11-02 15:42  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Fix XEMBED support. Actually, workaround Gtk
	  and Firefox bugs. i.e. don't let them kill the plugin window by
	  killing the old page window without calling either NPP_Destroy()
	  or SetWindow(instance, NULL) first.

2008-11-02 15:04  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-common.h: Fix npw_get_plugin_instance() for CrossOver
	  Plugin. They make a local copy of the original instance in stack
	  while preserving the same plugin private data (our
	  PluginInstance, fortunately!).

2008-10-29 05:40  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime.c, src/npw-common.h, src/npw-wrapper.c: Don't
	  claim we support interfaces we currently don't, i.e. NPAPI >=
	  0.18 is not fully implemented yet.

2008-10-29 05:26  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Fix NPP_URLNotify() (thanks to Bennet Yee).

2008-10-29 05:18  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-common.c, src/npw-common.h: Add an NPW_Identifier type
	  useful for implementing local NPIdentifier cache. It's silly to
	  do an RPC round trip simply to retrieve an integer or string
	  value. The NPRuntime caching strategy is not fully settled yet
	  though.

2008-10-29 05:14  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-rpc.c, src/npw-rpc.h, src/npw-viewer.c,
	  src/npw-wrapper.c: Create a specific NPUTF8 string marshaler.
	  The difference with normal RPC_TYPE_STRING is the recv()
	  allocates the string with NPN memory allocators.
	  
	  Besides, it's technically possible to pass a NULL argument to
	  the recv() handler and means "I don't care of the data you
	  received. Drop it, thanks". In practise, this is not useful but
	  all marshalers should be safe to NULL arguments and still work
	  afterwards (i.e. do receive data) in that case.

2008-10-29 04:05  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-malloc.c: Revert to libc free() if we don't have the

2008-10-05 21:39  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* TODO, src/npruntime.c, src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c,
	  src/rpc.c, tests/test-rpc-concurrent.c, tests/test-rpc-nested.c,
	  tests/test-rpc-types.c: Rework RPC code to cope with concurrent
	  rpc_method_invoke(). This function is now atomic. That is,
	  method id and its arguments are marshalled in one shot, there is
	  no intermediate wait for MSG_ACK.
	  
	  Notable change also includes the fact that optimization for
	  no-argument or no-return value cases is now gone. i.e. each
	  rpc_method_invoke() shall have an rpc_method_get_args() on the
	  other side, even if there is no arg passed. Besides, each
	  rpc_method_wait_for_reply() shall have an
	  rpc_method_send_reply() on the other side, even if the function
	  normally doesn't return anything.
	  
	  This optimization could be brought back into V3 protocol
	  specification. Current revision is now V2.5.

2008-07-06 19:52  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Flush the X output buffer so that the call to
	  gdk_pixmap_foreign_new() (and thus XGetGeometry()) can work in
	  the viewer. Otherwise, we sometimes get a BadDrawable.

2008-07-06 19:47  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Fix NPNVnetscapeWindow wrapper to create a

	  toplevel gdk window (and gtk window TBD).

2008-07-06 19:16  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Synchronize more NPWindow items in successive
	  NPP_SetWindow() calls, i.e. updates case.
	  create_window_attributes() and destroy_window_attributes() now
	  operate on an NPSetWindowCallbackStruct directly.

2008-07-06 17:05  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	  plugins.

2008-07-06 14:23  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-rpc.c, src/npw-viewer.c: Marshal
	  NPSetWindowCallbackStruct: only reconstruct XVisual based on the

	  plugins support.

2008-07-06 13:14  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-rpc.c, src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Propagate

	  headers to 0.19.

2008-07-01 20:38  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile: Fix build on platforms that are not biarch devel
	  capable.

2008-06-29 21:17  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* configure: Document --enable-strip.

2008-06-26 20:45  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-config.c: Don't install wrapped root plugins system-wide
	  but stick them to private mozilla plugins dir (typically
	  ~root/.mozilla/plugins/).

2008-06-23 22:08  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-player.c: Use the underlying g_quark_from_string() to
	  get a unique id from a string. This function is available on
	  older glib version 2.8 (FreeBSD 6.1). Quarks increase from zero.

2008-06-23 21:58  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile: Fix install.npplayer dependency. Explicitly link
	  against the pthread library since we are using gthread-2.0
	  (though this one should be linked against pthread by itself on
	  freebsd).

2008-06-23 21:56  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* configure: Check for GTK+ for standalone player build too.

2008-06-23 21:55  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/glibcurl.h: Fix missing include for older (and broken) curl
	  headers.

2008-06-23 21:17  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile: Always link against libgthread-2.0 (Ruediger Oertel),
	  including for non biarch build case.

2008-06-23 21:11  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

2008-06-23 21:04  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile: Don't bother with language and/or timezone during

2008-06-22 08:26  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile, src/libnoxshm.c, src/npw-viewer.sh: Don't allow
	  MIT-SHM (XShm, XVideo) when using QEMU as it causes some
	  endianness issues. Initial patch by Alexander Graf. Note that
	  you may also disable MIT-SHM for other platforms through
	  NPW_USE_XSHM set to no.

2008-06-21 20:14  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/cxxabi-compat.cpp, src/debug.c, src/debug.h, src/libxpcom.c,

	* src/rpc.c: In rpc_method_wait_for_reply(), move down arg type
	  extraction from varargs where it starts to be actually useful.

2008-06-04 20:44  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Properly fix parsing for npviewer.bin --info
	  with lengthy stdout.

2008-06-04 20:11  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Fix for npviewer.bin --info returning lines
	  larger than 255 chars (poor fix).

2008-05-25 15:22  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-player.c: Handle seekable streams (NP_SEEK) later,
	  currently consider they are not.

2008-05-25 15:10  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-player.c: Fix handling of NP_ASFILE and NP_ASFILEONLY
	  streams.

2008-05-25 10:03  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-player.c: Fix NPP_Write() emulation to actually emit the
	  current offset in the stream, not in the buffer being sent.

2008-05-25 10:00  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-player.c: Improve initialization of streams, i.e. try to
	  retrieve some information about the remote file (size, last
	  modification time).

2008-05-23 22:34  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-player.c: Fix check for size change.

2008-05-23 21:59  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-player.c: Propagate window resize requests.

2008-05-23 20:50  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-player.c: Fix propagation of a stream when it was fully
	  read prior to starting the emission to the other side. e.g. fix
	  advertising in Magic Pen or make Youtube playlists actually work.

2008-05-23 20:46  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-player.c: Allow arbitrary title to be set with the
	  --title option.

2008-05-23 20:44  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-player.c: Use <ctrl>-Q or <ctrl>-Escape to quit the
	  application.

2008-05-22 22:56  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile, configure, nspluginwrapper.spec, src/glibcurl.c,
	  src/glibcurl.h, src/gtk2xtbin.c, src/gtk2xtbin.h,
	  src/npw-player.c, src/sysdeps.h: Add standalone NPAPI plugins
	  player (Gtk backend only).

2008-05-22 21:24  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Improve debugging messages for npruntime
	  functions (NPVariant related) and NPP_NewStream().

2008-05-22 20:45  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Fix NPP_SetWindow() when the platform-specific
	  NPWindow::window member value is NULL. This means the plug-in
	  should not longer use the specified window and must free any
	  resources associated with it. Firefox doesn't do that but WebKit
	  does.

2008-05-22 16:49  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-rpc.c, src/npw-rpc.h, src/npw-viewer.c,
	  src/npw-wrapper.c, src/rpc.c, src/rpc.h: Drop last global
	  variable in RPC code (g_message_descriptors).
	  
	  As a consequence, message descriptors MUST be added to any
	  connection prior to using it. Actually, this now operates like
	  method descriptors. This is an API change that also drops
	  functions to remove methods or message types from a connection.
	  i.e. no need to expose an API that can still change in the
	  future (nspluginwrapper2).

2008-05-22 14:56  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/rpc.c: Fix propagation of the error code to the other side
	  when a message handler was not found.

2008-05-22 14:29  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* TODO, src/rpc.c: Fix passing of array elements to match exactly
	  what is defined in the message descriptor (.size field). i.e.
	  dynamic allocation of the element is delegated to the handler.
	  So, the array can be of static values or pointers to values, it
	  just depends on what the handler does.

2008-05-22 13:53  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/rpc.c: Robusty error cases during creation of a connection.

2008-05-22 13:04  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-rpc.h, src/rpc.c, src/rpc.h: Fix rpc_connection_ref() to
	  return self.

2008-05-22 12:55  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-rpc.h: Add RPC method and datatype IDs for debugging.

2008-05-22 12:34  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/debug.h, src/npw-rpc.h, src/rpc.c, src/rpc.h, src/sysdeps.h,
	  src/utils.h: Add guards for inclusion into C++ code.

2008-05-22 09:09  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* nspluginwrapper.spec: Trunk heads to 1.2.0.

2008-05-22 08:03  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile, configure: Rename a few options to --enable-style.
	  Allow stripping of binaries only through --enable-strip.

2007-12-25 11:04  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* ChangeLog: Generated by svn2cl.

2007-12-23 20:01  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile, src/npw-viewer.c: Initialize glib for multithreading,
	  aka fix crashes with newer Flash Player plugin (9.0.115).

2007-09-20 21:47  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* configure: Fix C99 support flag for Intel compiler.

2007-09-20 21:41  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile, configure: Allow build with XLC.

2007-09-02 06:35  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* ChangeLog: Generated by svn2cl.

2007-09-02 06:34  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Use per-plugin connection references. This
	  will prevent the use of the new (restarted) RPC connection with
	  old NPP instances.

2007-09-02 05:35  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c, src/rpc.c, src/rpc.h:
	  Implement and use rpc_connection_{ref,unref}().

2007-09-01 23:05  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Improve NPP_WriteReady()
	  and NPP_Write() error handling, aka consume as many bytes as
	  possible when we have an RPC error (for rpc_method_invoke() and
	  rpc_method_wait_for_reply'()).

2007-09-01 22:15  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* NEWS, nspluginwrapper.spec, src/npw-wrapper.c: Restart plugins
	  viewer when it crashed (initial patch by Martin Stransky).

2007-09-01 17:58  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/rpc.c: Fix rpc_dispatch() to set error status accordingly,
	  not for simple method IDs. Check connection state prior to
	  marshaling data in rpc_method_*().

2007-09-01 16:04  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/rpc.c, src/rpc.h: Maintain an RPC status (initial patch by
	  Martin Stransky for error handling). Fix rpc_method_send_reply()
	  to return RPC_ERROR_CONNECTION_NULL with NULL connections.

2007-08-26 09:53  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* ChangeLog: Generated by svn2cl.

2007-08-26 06:31  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Nuke the window border, it's quite disturbing
	  to see it during resizing.

2007-08-25 23:03  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* ChangeLog: Generated by svn2cl.

2007-08-25 22:48  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* NEWS, nspluginwrapper.spec: 0.9.91.5

2007-08-25 22:46  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npruntime.c, src/npw-viewer.c: Remove NPW_DISABLE_NPRUNTIME,
	  npruntime support has been working for a long time now.
	  Similarly, remove dummy npruntime handlers now that the common
	  supported NPAPI version is passed down.

2007-08-25 22:37  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Pass down common NPAPI
	  version supported by both the browser and nspluginwrapper. We no
	  longer need to check for npruntime support ourselves, rely only
	  on the NPAPI version reported. Yes, if the browser lies we may
	  crash, but that's be browser's fault anyway.

2007-08-25 07:05  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Implement LONG64 NPP_New() and NPP_Destroy().
	  Fix NPStream functions so that it works with correct 64-bit
	  Konqueror versions too. i.e. check for identify stream.

2007-08-25 07:01  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Fix memory leak when we don't want the
	  NPP_Destroy() NPSavedData. Remove useless comment since the
	  feature was implemented.

2007-08-25 06:59  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Fix NPP_GetValue(NPPVformValue) and call new
	  g_NPN_MemAlloc().

2007-08-24 16:07  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: Run-time detect broken 64-bit Konqueror
	  browsers and use another layer of thunks in that case.

2007-08-22 22:26  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* npapi/npapi.h, src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Implement
	  NPAPI 0.17 RESPONSE_HEADERS, i.e. propagate NPStream::headers to
	  the plug-in if it is available (NULL otherwise). Fix NPStream
	  initialization for NPN_NewStream().

2007-08-22 19:23  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile: Fix build on Debian 4.0 'Etch' (and derivatives)
	  though libxpcom.so is currently not used and other distributions
	  were capable enough to compile it without the LSB build-env
	  hacks.

2007-08-21 22:12  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c: Fix Flash Player 9 Update 3 beta plugin
	  support with XEMBED.

2007-08-21 05:02  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-rpc.c, src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Fix
	  marshaling of NPPrint structures, fix marsharling of NPP
	  instance in
	  NPP_Print(), and fix writeback when there is actually nothing to
	  commit.

2007-01-01 16:56  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-rpc.h, src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Remove the
	  need for NP_Exit(), gtk_main_quit() is called stratight once
	  NP_Shutdown() is done. Net let the plugin shutdown gracefully,
	  then kill

	* src/npw-wrapper.c: If NP_Exit() fails (or event shutdown?), we

2006-12-28 23:53  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/rpc.c: Fix send() in non-blocking mode. Move down test for
	  EINTR since it can also
	  match the (ret == -1 && errno == EINTR) case once rpc_poll()
	  returned.

2006-12-28 18:48  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c: Fix GSource RPC dispatch to
	  return FALSE only when the other side closed the
	  connection, not on other errors that could block processing of
	  next calls.

2006-12-28 18:46  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/rpc.c, src/rpc.h: Use non-blocking I/O by default so that we
	  can add an RPC_MESSAGE_TIMEOUT to
	  recv(). Besides, if the remote handler returns an error just
	  after an
	  rpc_method_get_args(), the error code is propagated to the other
	  side without
	  delay.

2006-12-28 16:42  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* Makefile: Use ln -sf to override possibly existing files.

2006-12-28 16:41  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* configure: Don't check for GTK environment if we are not
	  building the viewer. This helps
	  in reducing the build dependencies for e.g. pkgsrc.

2006-12-28 11:55  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* NEWS, nspluginwrapper.spec: New 0.9.91.2 snapshot.

2006-12-28 10:51  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-viewer.c, src/npw-wrapper.c, src/rpc.c, src/rpc.h:
	  Handle unexpected close of a connection (e.g. npviewer.bin
	  crashed). Let glib
	  remove the polling function on error but only call
	  g_source_destroy() and not
	  g_source_remove_poll() on exit. And, also fix the initialization
	  logic to not
	  initialize the RPC routines if we are not called from
	  NP_Initialize().

2006-12-28 07:50  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/rpc.c, src/rpc.h: Remove dead code (rpc_connection_busy()).

2006-12-27 10:23  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* nspluginwrapper.spec: 0.9.91.2 snapshot.

2006-12-27 01:00  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* NEWS, src/npw-viewer.c, src/rpc.c, src/rpc.h: Implement and
	  document RPC protocol version 2.1. This fixes a remaining
	  mis-synchronisation that could happen on occasion upon function
	  termination.
	  i.e. add one more barrier after rpc_method_wait_for_reply().
	  This also
	  renders the delayed method invoke mechanism obsolete. In
	  practise, this
	  fixes <http://www.flashearth.com/>, in particular when rapidly
	  switching
	  image sources (NPN_GetURLNotify(), NPN_PostURLNotify() and
	  NPP_NewStream()
	  were generated in mass and triggered the bug).

	  functions to debug.c.

2006-12-25 07:46  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

2006-12-24 18:53  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-rpc.c: Fix marshaling of NP_NOTIFY_DATA, don't use
	  id_create() from plugin-side as
	  this is a browser-side specific function. Simply pass the
	  notifyData pointer.

2006-12-24 15:59  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>

	* src/npw-rpc.c, src/npw-rpc.h, src/npw-viewer.c,
	  src/npw-wrapper.c: Handle notifyData as plugin-side opaque
	  pointers, i.e. browser-side doesn't
	  need to know what they represent so they can be single IDs
	  there. Shorten
	  NPP_NewStream() to have stype as output only (not for input,
	  it's initialized
	  in the plug-in side prior to calling the plugin NPP_NewStream()).

2006-12-24 12:37  Gwenole Beauchesne <gb.public@free.fr>
