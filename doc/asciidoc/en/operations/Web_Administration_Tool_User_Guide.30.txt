Web Administration Tool User Guide
----------------------------------
Login
~~~~~

That's your very first step, to log in use the default user (login:admin password:admin) or the one you define with the Web Administration Tool (have a look at the documentation).

Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~

Gives you an overview of the QVD state:

    * Virtual machines running, failed or stopped.
    * Sessions in course and potential (equals the number of virtual machines).
    * And the totals of users, virtual machines, nodes (physical machines that host the virtual) and images (templates for virtual machines).

Virtual machines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With these pages you can view the current virtual machines defined in QVD and the users and machine states. Also you can start, stop and delete virtual machines as well as disconnect a concrete user. 

Connecting via VNC to a machine
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * Click the magnifying glass icon on the row of the virtual machine.
    * Click "VNC local client". 

Nodes
~~~~~

Here you can define new nodes and check the actual ones. To remove a node you must use the Command Line Interface. 

To create a node just add a name and the ip address.
