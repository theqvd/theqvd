[[QVD_NODE]]
QVD Server Nodes are the work-horses within the QVD infrastructure. They consist of
three major components:

* *QVD Node* - Responsible for managing the L7R and HKD elements
* *L7R* - A Layer-7 Router that acts as the broker within the server
  environment, responsible for authenticating users, establishing
  sessions and routing connections to the appropriate virtual IP
  addresses. In general, the L7R is responsible for managing user
  status.
* *HKD* - A 'House Keeping Daemon' that tracks the status of virtual·
  machines. The HKD is responsible for starting and stopping virtual
  machines. The HKD monitors the health of each virtual machine and·
  then updates status information within the QVD Database, so that·
  other Nodes and the administration tools are able to function·
  accordingly. In general, the HKD is responsible for managing virtual
  machine status.

Usually Server Nodes are installed across a number of systems running as a cluster.
This means that within a typical deployment you are likely to have any number
of Server Nodes that will need to be installed and configured.

You should familiarize yourself with the general architecture of a server node
by referring to the chapter in this manual labelled _Components and Architecture_ and in
particular the subsection labelled <<qvd_node_architecture,QVD Server Architecture>>.

Installation of a QVD Server Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On any of the systems that you intend to install the QVD Server Node components, you will need to add
the QVD repository to your apt sources. You can do this with the
following command:

----
apt-add-repository 'deb http://theqvd.com/debian lucid main'
----

Execute `apt-get update` after modifying sources.list.

To install all of the QVD Server Node components and their dependencies, run the following command:

----
# sudo apt-get install qvd-node
----

This will install all of the qvd-node components along with any existing dependencies. In general
we recommend that the QVD CLI Administration Utility is installed on any of the QVD Server Node systems
as well, since it is common to work directly from these systems to configure QVD quickly. You can
find out more about this utility in the following chapter labelled <<qvd-admin-cli, QVD CLI Administration Utility>>.

Base Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As with most other QVD infrastructure components, every QVD Server Node requires access to the QVD Database.
You will need to ensure that the QVD Node configuration file is set up correctly in order for the QVD Server Node 
to function properly. You can find out how to do this in chapter titled
<<qvd_db_config,QVD Base Configuration>>.

Unlike most other components, QVD Server Nodes require an additional entry within the QVD Base Configuration
file in order to be able to quickly search within the QVD-DB. This is a single line entry that should be
appended to your configuration, containing the *nodename* which should match the name that you assign to
your node when you register it within the QVD-DB, either using QVD-WAT or using the·QVD CLI Administration Utility.

In general, we recommend that you name your nodes using the hostname of the system that they are running on.

This can be quickly achieved by doing something like the following:

----
echo "nodename=`hostname`" >> /etc/qvd/node.conf
----

Networking Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
QVD Server Nodes make use of a network bridge and virtual network interfaces to facilitate
networking across each of the virtual machines that run on the node. In order to automatically
provision IP addresses to virtual machines, QVD also runs a DHCP server that will allocate
IP addresses within the virtual network range to virtual hosts as they boot up.

There are a number of configuration steps that may need to be configured manually in order
to properly set up the networking for a QVD Server Node. There are often other ways to achieve
an appropriate network configuration, so we provide these only as guidelines.

Set dnsmasq to be controlled by QVD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

QVD uses dnsmasq as a DHCP and DNS server for the virtual machines
that run in a node. In order to function correctly, dnsmasq needs to
be run by the qvd-node process. By default, the Ubuntu package starts
the process running as a daemon in the background, so you need to stop 
it from starting automatically. This is done with the following commands.

----
# /etc/init.d/dnsmasq stop
# sed -i s/ENABLED=1/ENABLED=0/ /etc/default/dnsmasq
----

Note: This step is essential in order for QVD to work using KVM virtualization. For LXC
virtualization, it is possible to specify whether or not to make use of DHCP to configure
the networking within your virtual machines.

Configure IP forwarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

IP Forwarding is required in order to route clients to the correct location.
You can do this quickly by running the following command.

----
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
----

Unfortunately, when you reboot you host system, this change will be
lost. To make it permanent, you can edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and
uncomment the line:

----
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
----

You can force sysctl to reload its settings after you have edited this
file by running:

----
# sysctl -p
----

Configure a Network Bridge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are a number of ways to go about configuring your network bridge
and the appropriate routing to make sure that a QVD client is routed
to the correct virtual machine.

The easiest method is to set up a static network interface and to
configure a set of *iptables* routing rules to perform the NAT
required to translate IP addresses between your real and virtual
network interfaces. Using NAT is necessary within a mononode installation,
but on a deployment using multiple nodes and where different components run
on different systems, the iptables routing rules would not be necessary.
To configure you networking, edit the file `/etc/network/interfaces` and add 
the following lines.

----
auto qvdnet0
iface qvdnet0 inet static
  pre-up brctl addbr qvdnet0
  pre-up iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o qvdnet0 -j SNAT to-source 192.168.0.2
  pre-up iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 192.168.0.2 -p tcp --dport 8443 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.3.15.1
  address 10.3.15.1
  netmask 255.255.255.0
----

It is important to note that in the above example you will need to
change the IP address *192.168.0.2* to the IP address of the network
interface that you intend your clients to connect to.

While there are other cleaner approaches to setting up your network,
these sometimes run into problems with particular network interfaces
such as WIFI. The approach listed above should work for most systems.

Once you have written the network configuration to file, you should
bring up the network bridge interface.

----
# ifup qvdnet0
----

NOTE: If using SLES, we recommend that you use Yast2 to configure your network bridge.

Configure QVD for your Networking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In order for QVD to properly manage virtual machine setup and the subsequent routing,
you will need to change some configuration settings within QVD-DB. It is recommended
that you make use of the <<qvd-admin-cli,QVD CLI Administration Utility>> to do this.

----
# qvd-admin.pl config set vm.network.ip.start=10.1.0.50
# qvd-admin.pl config set vm.network.netmask=16
# qvd-admin.pl config set vm.network.gateway=10.1.0.1
# qvd-admin.pl config set vm.network.dns_server=10.1.1.254
# qvd-admin.pl config set vm.network.bridge=qvdnet0
----

These settings are described in more details in the section of this document entitled <<vm_options,Virtual Machine Options>> in the 
Base QVD Configuration chapter.

Configuring SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The QVD server needs an x509 certificate and private key for securing
network connections. For a production installation you should use a
certificate issued by a recognized certificate authority, such as
Verisign or Thawte. For testing purposes you can use a self-signed
certificate. We provide instructions on creating a self-signed certificate
in the _Guide to Getting Started With QVD_.

If you have a certificate signed by a third party, you can register it with
QVD using the QVD CLI Administration Utility:

----
# qvd-admin.pl config ssl key=/path/to/private/key.pem cert=/path/to/server/certificate.pem
----
