[[QVD_Client]]
The QVD client is available for both Linux and Microsoft Windows
platforms. Certainly, we recommend that for more seamless integration
you should consider running the client on a Linux platform. However,
it is quite possible that you have users that make use of both
environments and would like to run a virtualized Linux desktop from
within Windows.

Downloading and Installing the Windows Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using Microsoft Windows as your base platform to run the
QVD Client application, you will need to download the QVD Client
installer manually. You can download the installer from:

http://qvd.qindel.com/qvd3/windows/qvd-client-3.0.0-1-setup.exe

Once you have finished downloading the installer, run it as a normal
executable file and follow the wizard through the installation
process.

Once you have finished the installation, you can either run the client
from the shortcut on your Windows desktop (if you selected to add the
shortcut) or from the QVD menu in your Applications menu. This will
open the client so that you are ready to connect.

Downloading and Installing the Ubuntu Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installing the QVD Client on an Ubuntu Linux platform is simple. You
should add the QVD repository to your apt repository sources. Run the
following commands as root:

----
# apt-add-repository 'deb http://theqvd.com/debian lucid main'
# apt-get update
----

You will now be able to install the client with the following command.

----
sudo apt-get install qvd-client
----

Depending on your Desktop Environment, you should be able to access
the client within your 'Applications' menu, usually under the
'Internet' submenu. Alternatively, you can run the client GUI from the
console using the command `qvd-gui-client.pl`.

Connecting to your Virtual Desktop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you have the GUI client running, you can enter the *Username* for
the user that you created in QVD, the *Password* that you configured
for the user, the *Server* hostname or IP address for the QVD Server
Node that you created, and you can choose the level of compression for
the connection by selecting a *Connection type*.

By default, the *Connection type* is set to 'Local'. This setting is
appropriate for connections over a local area network. There are also
options for 'ADSL', which would be appropriate for any broadband
connection, and for 'Modem' which can be used in cases where bandwidth
is severely limited or impaired.

Changing the *Connection type* will increase the compression used to
deliver the virtual desktop across your network connection. It also
increases the amount of caching that the client performs to limit the
amount of screen refreshing that needs to take place.

In general, using heavy compression and caching will still afford your
users the ability to work comfortably within their virtual desktops.
However the quality of graphical rendering will be a little inferior.

Once you have completed entering your connection details, simply click
on the button labelled *Connect* and your virtual desktop should load.

Additional Settings For QVD Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The QVD Client can be configured with some default settings that can tune its behaviour
to provide better integration or a cleaner user experience. These settings are found
in the `client.conf` file. Under Linux this file is usually in the user's home directory
at `/home/someuser/.qvd/client.conf`. On Windows, this file is usually
found within `%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\.qvd\client.conf`.

The client config file can have the following settings:

----
client.link = local
client.geometry = 1024x768
client.fullscreen = 1
client.audio.enable = 1
client.printing.enable = 1
client.host.port = 8443
client.host.name = loadbalancer.mydomain.com
client.user.name = guest
client.use_ssl = 1
----

The meanings for the above settings are explained in the list below:

* *client.link*: this is the equivalent of the 'Connection Type'
  setting. Options include 'local', 'adsl' and 'modem'.
* *client.geometry*: screen size for the client, if not set to use
  fullscreen
* *client.fullscreen*: whether or not to display the client in
  fullscreen mode
* *client.audio.enable*: whether or not to enable audio within the
  client. You will need to configure this on the OSF as well.
* *client.printing.enable*: whether or not to enable printer sharing
  within the client. You will need to configure this on the OSF as
  well.
* *client.host.port*: the default port to connect to your server nodes
  on. Do not change this unless you have reconfigured all of your
  server nodes to use a different port number for some reason.
* *client.host.name*: the default hostname or IP address that the
  client should connect to. Usually you would specify a load balancer
  or one of your server node IP addresses here.
* *client.user.name*: the default username to connect as.
* *client.use_ssl*: whether or not to use SSL to encrypt the client
  connection.
