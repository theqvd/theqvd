[[config_systempaths]]
The following options are available to change the paths that QVD uses to search for applications, certificates and other QVD
specific data.

----
path.run = /var/run/qvd
path.log = /var/log
path.tmp = /var/tmp
path.storage.root = /var/lib/qvd/storage
path.storage.staging = ${path.storage.root}/staging
path.storage.images = ${path.storage.root}/images
path.storage.overlays = ${path.storage.root}/overlays
path.storage.homes = ${path.storage.root}/homes
path.ssl.certs = ${path.run}/ssl
path.ssl.ca.system = /etc/ssl/certs
path.ssl.ca.personal = .qvd/certs
path.serial.captures = ${path.tmp}/qvd

command.kvm = kvm
command.kvm-img = kvm-img
command.nxagent = /usr/bin/nxagent
command.nxdiag = /usr/bin/nxdiag.pl
command.x-session = /etc/X11/Xsession

command.useradd = /usr/sbin/useradd
command.userdel = /usr/sbin/userdel

* *path.tmp*: the path to store temporary files
* *path.storage.root*: the base path for the main storage area used by QVD
* *path.storage.staging*: the staging directory used to hold temporary DIs
* *path.storage.images*: the images directory used to hold registered DIs
* *path.storage.overlays*: the overlays directory used to hold overlay qcow images
* *path.storage.homes*: the homes directory used to hold user home data qcow images
* *path.ssl.certs*: the path to store SSL certificates used by QVD
* *path.ssl.ca.system*: the path to where system CA certificates are stored
* *path.ssl.ca.personal*: the path to where local or personal CA certificates are stored
* *path.serial.captures*: the location used to store serial captures (if <<config_vm,enabled>>)
* *command.kvm*: the command to run the Kernel Virtual Machine 
* *command.kvm-img*: the command used to work with QEMU virtual disks within the KVM
* *command.nxagent*: the path to the nxagent binary (usually only used by the VMA on an OSF)
* *command.nxdiag*: the path to the nxdiag.pl script used by the VMA to ensure that nxagent is running properly
* *command.x-session*: the path to the XSession shell script run by the system when an X Windows session is started
