Introduction
------------
In this guide we will provide an introduction to QVD and will present
the basic steps that you will need to take in order to set up and
configure QVD server and the various auxillary components that you
will make use of. This guide is intended to help administrators
understand how to set QVD up from scratch in a demonstration
environment. It will provide the most simple installation and
configuration instructions that can be used to get started. It will
not go into any detail about additional configuration steps or
build functionality, as these details will be covered in the _QVD
Administration Manual_.

Please note that while versions of QVD since version 3.1 are capable of
supporting LXC virtualization, this guide will explain how to configure
the environment for the default KVM virtualization, in order to keep 
things as simple as possible. If you are interested in configuring your
QVD installation to take advantage of LXC, please refer to the chapter
titled 'Using LXC Virtualization in QVD' in the _QVD Administration Manual_.

QVD is under continuous development. While we try to keep all of our
documentation up to date with the current version, it is possible that
some new functionality is provided before the documentation has been
updated. If there are sections in this document which are have become
obsolete, or if you find that some of the instructions provided do not
work as expected, please do not hesitate to contact us.

Components and Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this guide, we will not spend a long time discussing the different
components that make up QVD in great detail, however it is important
to understand the basic architecture and how each of the components
interacts so that you are aware of what needs to be installed and
configured in order to get your QVD environment up and running.

QVD {qvdversion} is composed of several parts:

* QVD client,
* QVD server,
* Administration tools,
* PostgreSQL DBMS,
* Shared Storage.

These components can be installed on the same system for testing and evaluation.
Naturally, if you are installing all components on the same system,
you will not need to make use of shared storage, however in a
production environment you would usually make this available over some
network file system like NFS, OCFS2 or GFS2.

For production use we recommend using separate machines for the database, 
administration tools, and QVD servers. In order to reduce the
complexity of your host networking requirements, we certainly
recommend that when testing and evaluating QVD, you run the client
from a separate workstation. This will also help you to see QVD
functioning in the way that it is supposed to work.

QVD Client
^^^^^^^^^^
The QVD Client is the application that the User will run in order to
access his or her own desktop. QVD provides client applications in
a variety of package formats and for a selection of base operating
systems, including Linux '.deb' and '.rpm' packages for Ubuntu and
SUSE Linux distributions and a Windows executable for Microsoft
Windows environments.

The QVD Client is a modified NX client that will connect to the
QVD Server node, where it will be authenticated before loading the
user's Desktop environment. The client comes with a GUI that makes
connecting to a Server a little more user-friendly, but the GUI is not
required. In order for the client to connect, it must be configured to
provide a user name and password, along with the server node's FQDN or 
IP address. There is also an option to control the connection type.
For this, there are three possibilities:

* _Local_ - For connections with high bandwidth, such as a LAN
* _ADSL_ - For connections with broadband speed bandwidth, such as an
  ADSL connection
* _Modem_ - For low bandwidth connections

Changing the connection type controls the amount of compression and
caching that is performed by the client. This means that for High
Bandwidth connections, less compression and caching is performed and
the quality of the desktop display is much better than for lower
bandwidth connections.

QVD Server
^^^^^^^^^^
The QVD Server is also known as a Node, and represents the physical
location where a QVD server daemon is running. In an enterprise
environment, it is possible that you may have multiple QVD Server
nodes to handle high load etc.

QVD Server is responsible for accepting requests from the QVD Client
and for loading a Virtual Machine to serve the client request. In
order to facilitate authentication requests, and to determine which
image to load within the Virtual Machine, QVD Server makes use of a
PostgreSQL database which is generally referred to as QVD-DB.

In actual fact, the QVD Server is comprised of two separate core
components:

* *L7R* - A level-7 router, is the broker responsible for handling client 
  connections. It ensures that clients are routed to the correct virtual 
  IP address that is configured for the Virtual Machine that has been 
  created for the connecting user. It is also responsible for authenticating 
  the user prior to connection, and for establishing the client
  session.
* *HKD* - The 'House Keeping Daemon', is responsible for starting and
  stopping virtual machines, and updating status within the PostgreSQL
  database.

In order for QVD Server to work correctly, it must have access to the
PostgreSQL database, and it must have a properly configured network
bridge in place. Configuring the Server can be relatively simple, but
there are many options that apply to the L7R and HKD to fine tune
behaviour. We will not cover these additional options in this
document, but will provide the most basic configuration required in
order to get QVD Server running.

QVD Server is responsible for loading the image used for the base
operating system that will be served to the client, and connecting
this with the user home directory. The QVD Server also makes use of
'overlays' that can be used to store temporary data such as log and
temporary files. In general, overlays are locally hosted and are
destroyed when the Virtual Machine is shutdown. It is possible to make
these persistent, by mounting the overlay store on a network share. But
we will cover these topics a little later.

QVD Administration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
QVD comes with a set of administration tools that help with the
configuration of QVD Server, and which allow you to easily add users.

For ease of use, the QVD Web Administration Tool (WAT) should be
installed and set up, so that you are easily able to administer the
QVD infrastructure. The QVD-WAT provides a simple user interface to
monitor the status of QVD, including the Virtual Machines that are
running or that have stopped; the sessions that are currently open;
and the number of users, virtual machines, nodes, operating systems and images that are
used within the solution.

The QVD-WAT also provides tools to manage users, set up Virtual
Machines, and upload new images.

In order to function properly, the QVD-WAT needs access to the
PostgreSQL database and should have access to the
`/var/lib/qvd/storage` directory. Often, this is mounted across NFS so 
that images can be shared with the QVD Server Nodes that require them.

Like most of the QVD components, QVD-WAT is coded in Perl. QVD-WAT
makes use of the Perl Catalyst framework to facilitate much of its
code-base, and includes its own web-server, which runs on TCP port
3000 by default.

It is possible to administer your QVD Solution without installing the
QVD-WAT, by using the command line interface. To do this, you will
need to install the 'qvd-admin' tool. QVD-admin is a perl script that
is capable of performing any of the administration tasks available
through the QVD-WAT from the command line. It also includes some
additional functionality that may be useful to an administrator, such
as the option to perform a backup of the PostgreSQL database.

You will need at least one of these two tools to configure your QVD
Solution properly.

PostgreSQL DBMS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
QVD stores information about users, virtual machines, nodes, operating systems and images
within a PostgreSQL database. This database is a central component
that is used by each QVD Server Node, as well as the QVD
Administration tools. It is used to determine the status of the
overall solution and to manage users, sessions and all of the
individual components in the solution.

The PostgreSQL database can be installed using the 'qvd-db' package, which
includes all of the required dependencies as well as the tools needed
to create and configure the database for use within the QVD solution. 
It is possible to make use of an existing PostgreSQL installation, and the QVD
team can also provide you with advice on how to set up a PostgreSQL cluster for 
better redundancy and performance, but these topics will not be covered in this 
guide.

Shared Storage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In a production level deployment, the QVD components are usually
installed on separate systems in order to provide better running
stability and to ensure that adequate system resources are available
for each logically independent task. Nonetheless, the QVD
Administration Tools and the QVD Server Nodes need access to shared
storage components in order to manage and load system images, user
profiles and user data.

QVD keeps all commonly used files in the directory location:

    /var/lib/qvd/storage

Within this location there are a number of subdirectories which are 
usually stored on some form of network accessible shared storage facility,
and are mounted according to your requirements. The majority of these
directories are related to the type of virtualization that you choose
to make use of within your QVD deployment (KVM or LXC).

While we will *not* be making use of shared storage in this guide, since 
all of the components will be installed on the same system and will
have access to the same storage directories, you should be aware that
in a normal environment you will have to configure NFS mountpoints for
some of the directories listed below. If you are interested in setting
your environment up in this way, please refer to the _QVD Administration
Manual_, where the chapter titled 'Design Considerations and
Integration' contains information on configuring NFS for QVD.

General Storage
+++++++++++++++

* *staging*: temporary location for all DIs that you want available in
  the QVD-WAT for the purpose of loading as an image. Files located
  here are available within QVD-WAT when you select to add an image.
  The image file will be copied out of this directory and into the
  *images* folder when it is enabled using one of the administration tools. 
  The staging folder can either be hosted locally or on a network share, 
  but must be accessible to the QVD-WAT.
* *images*: location of the DIs (Disk Images) that are
  loaded by the nodes for each Virtual Machine that is created. These
  need to be accessible to QVD Server Nodes and to the QVD-WAT. This
  directory might be stored on a network share, but in a very simple
  configuration where the QVD-WAT is either not used or is hosted on
  the same system as the QVD Server Node, it can be hosted locally
  which will help to improve performance. Note that where KVM 
  virtualization is used, the image is loaded into the virtual machine
  from this directory. When LXC virtualization is used, the image is
  extracted from this directory into the *basefs* directory, before it
  is loaded.


KVM Storage Directories
+++++++++++++++++++++++

* *homes*: location of user home data. Under KVM, home data
  is stored in individual files as qcow2 images. The *homes* directory 
  should be accessible to all QVD Server Nodes usually on some type of 
  network file share such as NFS, OCFS2 or GFS2.
* *overlays*: location used to store overlays for data that is constantly
  written to the Operating System in order for it to function correctly, such
  as temporary files and variable data etc. Usually this folder can be hosted 
  locally, but for more persistent behaviour in your virtual machines, you can 
  choose to store these on a network share and configure QVD to make your 
  virtual machines persistent.

LXC Storage Directories
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Note that while we will not be taking advantage of LXC Virtualization for this 
guide, it is useful to understand what the other directories within the storage
area are used for and how LXC differs from KVM.

* *basefs*:  location of the DIs (Disk Images) that are
  loaded by the nodes for each Virtual Machine that is created. These
  need to be accessible to QVD Server Nodes and to the QVD-WAT. This
  directory might be stored on an network share, but in a very simple
  configuration where the QVD-WAT is either not used or is hosted on
  the same system as the QVD Server Node, it can be hosted locally
  which will help to improve performance. The basefs folder will contain
  a subdirectory for each DI, which will in turn contain the complete 
  filesystem tree for a functioning operating system
* *homesfs*: location of user home data. Under LXC, home data
  is stored within subdirectories inside the *homesfs* directory, named 
  according to the user-id and the osf-id stored within the QVD-DB. 
  The *homesfs* directory should be accessible to all QVD Server Nodes 
  usually on some type of network file share such as NFS, OCFS2 or GFS2.
* *overlayfs*: location used to store overlays for data that is constantly
  written to the Operating System in order for it to function correctly, such
  as temporary files and variable data etc. Usually this folder can be hosted 
  locally, but for more persistent behaviour in your virtual machines, you can 
  choose to store these on a network share and configure QVD to make your 
  virtual machines persistent.
* *rootfs*: location of the running LXC once all required mountpoints have
  been mounted and configured. Usually this folder is local to each QVD
  Node Server, for performance, but it could equally be stored within the
  shared storage space.


include::HighLevelArchitectureDiagrams.txt[]

Planning your QVD Solution
--------------------------
In this guide, we are assuming that you want to set up your first QVD
demonstration environment. For this reason, we will assume that the
server-side components within the solution will be hosted on the same
physical server. We call this a 'mononode' installation. In order to 
keep things as simple as possible, we will also assume that you will 
test the solution using the QVD Client installed on a separate workstation. 
Although it is possible to have all of the components including the client 
running on the same machine, it is easier to demonstrate the
capabilities of the VDI if you connect from a distinct workstation.

Since all of the components will be running on the same system, we
will not be too concerned about shared storage. However, it is
important to understand that QVD makes use of some common storage
between different components in the solution, and that to maximize the
potential of your solution it is likely that some of these storage
directories should be located on a network file share on a NAS device 
or a SAN.

With all of this in mind, we will continue to build this solution on a
single host to keep things as simple as possible. In reality, it is
more than likely that a production environment would keep each of the
different components on different systems and the storage would be
managed across the different systems that are interacting within the
solution. If you feel comfortable configuring NFS shares, and building 
and installing each component on a different machine, please feel free 
to do so.

QVD currently has packages for the server-side components available
for the SUSE Linux and Ubuntu Linux distributions. This guide will
assume that you are installing the packages on Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid
Lynx). The instructions will mostly be similar for SUSE Linux, but
where different, we will attempt to provide SuSE commands directly. 

General Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Ubuntu Linux
^^^^^^^^^^^^
The QVD components require the Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx) GNU/Linux
operating system. Run the following command to update `/etc/apt/sources.list` 
on any systems where you intend to install QVD components

----
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:qvd-qindel/qvd-3.1
----

[NOTE]
===================================================================
If you are running on Lucid Lynx, and have not already done
so, you may need to install *python-software-properties* before you
attempt to use *apt-add-repository*.
===================================================================

Execute `apt-get update` after adding the QVD debian repository.

The QVD repository provides the following packages:

    * *qvd-demo-single-instance-nosupport*: meta-package to install a
      demonstration configuration on a single host
    * *qvd-client*: QVD GUI Client software
    * *qvd-l7r*: Layer-7 Router brokering component for the QVD Server
    * *qvd-hkd*: House Keeping Daemon for the QVD Server
    * *qvd-admin*: command line tools for managing users, virtual machines, operating system and images
    * *qvd-vma*: agent that runs within virtual machines
    * *qvd-wat*: Web Administration Tool
    * *qvd-db*: central database for the platform

Each of these packages will have a number of dependencies that 
can be satisfied by other packages provided from the usual Ubuntu
repositories. A summary of other Open Source components required by
QVD follows:

    * The PostgreSQL RDBMS.
    * KVM: Hypervisor.
    * LXC: Linux containers userspace tools
    * libvirt0: a library for interfacing with different virtualization systems
    * NX: protocol that handles remote desktop connections.
    * Catalyst: an MVC web-application framework for Perl
    * Ebtables: a IP-based firewalling utility for ethernet bridges

IMPORTANT: At the moment QVD works only on PostgreSQL 8, and
libcatalyst-perl version 5.80024-1. These are the default versions
currently provided with Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx).

SuSE Linux
^^^^^^^^^^
The QVD Server Environment can also be installed on the SuSE Linux
Enterprise Server 11 (SP1 x86_64).

The packages for the QVD Server Environment are available at 
https://build.opensuse.org/project/show?project=home%3Aqvd%3Aqvd-3.0

Run the following command to add the repository to your system.

----
sudo zypper ar-3.0.0 http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/qvd:/qvd-3.0/SLE_11_SP1 QVD
----
Execute `sudo zypper refresh` after adding the QVD repository. You
will need to accept the certificate that you are presented with. We
recommend that you accept the certificate permanently by pressing 'a'
on your keyboard.

You may be required to provide your installation disk to complete the
operation.

The OpenBuild repository used by the QVD provides the following main
packages (along with any dependencies not covered in the default SLES repositories):

    * *qvd-demo*: meta-package to install a demonstration configuration on a single host
    * *qvd-client*: QVD GUI Client software
    * *qvd-admin*: command line tools for managing users, virtual machines, operating system and images
    * *qvd-vma*: agent that runs within virtual machines
    * *qvd-wat*: Web Administration Tool
    * *qvd-db*: central database for the platform

As above, Open Source components required by QVD follow:

    * The PostgreSQL RDBMS.
    * KVM: Hypervisor.
    * NX: protocol that handles remote desktop connections.
    * Catalyst: an MVC web-application framework for Perl
    * Ebtables: a IP-based firewalling utility for ethernet bridges

System Hardware Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The QVD server side components should usually be run on independent
systems to ensure that they have adequate resources to run, and
hardware requirements will vary depending on the number of users that
you wish to service, the number of different Operating System Disk Images
that you intend to make use of and various other factors.

For the sake of this guide, which assumes that you are evaluating QVD
and will only install a single image and set up a one or two users at
most, we recommend the following system hardware requirements as a
guideline:

*System Processor*: 64-bit processor preferrably with more than one
core and supporting virtualization extensions (Intel or AMD). You can
support around 8 users per core.

*System Memory*: At least 2GB RAM. This should be sufficient for up to
4 users.

*Disk Space*: At least 4GB disk space should be available to contain
your operating system image etc. More than likely, you should try to
double this to work comfortably with the tools involved in importing
an image.

*Network Interface*: You will need at least one network interface
available. A 10/100 Ethernet NIC should be perfectly sufficient. We
have succeeded in serving desktops over Wireless connections as well.

You may use any client system to run the QVD Client software, as long
as it supports Linux or a modern Microsoft Windows operating system.

Installing the QVD Demo Metapackage
-----------------------------------
[[qvd_metapackage]]
The QVD provides a QVD Demo Metapackage. Installing this package on a
single host will automate many of the steps described in this
document. This package is designed to set up and configure a
demonstration QVD environment that runs off a single host, and will
help you to quickly build a QVD solution that can be used to
demonstrate QVD's capabilities without spending time on the initial
configuration steps.

It is important to understand that aside from installing QVD specific
components, installing the QVD Demo package, you will be installing
and configuring additional components. The installation will include
the modification of some system files, including the creation
of a bridged network interface (qvdnet0),·installation, configuration 
and creation of the PostgreSQL database with the following information:

----
Database Name = QVDDatabase
Database User = qvduser
Database Password = passw0rd
----

Some IPTables rules are also created in order to facilitate
networking, and your system will be be configured to enable IP
Forwarding.

If you choose to install the QVD Demo Metapackage, we highly recommend
that you read all of this document so that you understand all of the
steps that will take place during the installation.

Ubuntu Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can install this package by running the following command:

----
# sudo apt-get install qvd-demo-single-instance-nosupport
----

IMPORTANT: If you choose to install a demonstration environment using
this metapackage, you can skip through most of this document but you
will still need to load an OSF image, set up your first user and
create a virtual machine. There are a few things to note if you take
this path. Firstly, the metapackage is unsupported, in that it is only
designed for demonstration purposes and assumes that your environment
is ready to support QVD. For this reason, we highly recommend that you
still read through this document so that you understand all of the
steps that will be performed by the metapackage, in case something
goes wrong. Secondly, if the metapackage installs successfully and the
environment is set up correctly, you should be able to skip to the
section titled: *Installing and Configuring QVD-WAT* and pick up the
instructions from the subsection titled <<QVD-WAT-Running,Running>>. 

Suse Linux
~~~~~~~~~~
You can install the QVD Demo package by running the following command:

----
# sudo Zypper install-demo QVD
----

Unlike the Ubuntu Demo Package, the SuSE Demo Package also includes a a script called install-node.sh 
which will not only create a new QVD node after it has run, but will also setup a first user, create a virtual machine for that user
and will provide the option to download and set up a disk image.

At the prompt, you will be able to choose between a 'local' or 'network' download for the installation of the disk image. If you choose 'network', the
script will automatically connect to the QVD website and present you with the Disk Image options that you are able to download and install automatically.
Currently, these options will be presented as follows:

----
http://theqvd.com/downloads/demo/demo-ubuntu-gnome.img.gz (ubuntu-gnome)
http://theqvd.com/downloads/demo/demo-ubuntu-kde.img.gz (ubuntu-kde)
----

If you select the 'local' install option, you will need to have already downloaded one of these images, and it should have been uncompressed manually:

----
gunzip qvd-demo-gnome.img.gz
----

You will then need to provide the installer script with the full path to the image file.

Once the installer script has finished loading the disk image, it will be installed into the QVD environment and a demonstration user will be created.
This user is given the following credentials:

----
user: demouser
pass: passw0rd
----

Finally, a Virtual Machine is created for the user and the Disk Image that you downloaded will automatically be loaded within this Virtual Machine.

Once the script has finished running, the Demo installation will be complete. At this point, you can either attempt to login to your QVD platform using
the QVD Client software, or you can open up the QVD Web Administration Tool by pointing your browser at http://localhost:3000/ and logging in with the
default username 'admin' and default password 'admin'.

NOTE: While the SuSE Demo Package will perform nearly all of the steps that are included in this document, we recommend that you continue reading
through the rest of the document to get a more thorough understanding of how the different components tie together.

Installing and Configuring QVD DB
---------------------------------
Since one of the most fundamental components in the QVD solution is
the QVD database, we suggest that you install this first. The database
will be used to tie all of the other components together and to enable
them to interact. The QVD software has a PostgreSQL database at its
core. All the configuration and runtime information is stored in the 
database and if it fails the full platform will stop working. 

On production systems, it is highly recommended that the database is installed 
in a high availability configuration, so that it does not become a
likely point of failure for your VDI solution. In general, the actual hardware 
requirements are very modest, any modern server with just two CPU cores and 
2GB of RAM will be able to support the database load.

In this demonstration configuration, it is unlikely that you will
generate much load and we will assume that your test platform will be
able to cope with the requirements.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The preferred way to install the central database is with the package
qvd-db. It installs the PostgreSQL database system if needed.

NOTE: At the moment QVD works only on PostgreSQL 8.

To install run as root:

----
root@myserver:~# apt-get install qvd-db
----

After installing qvd-db you have to perform various manual steps. They
are

   1. creating a user account,
   2. creating a database,
   3. changing the database configuration, and
   4. deploying the QVD database schema.·

The first two steps need to be performed using the database administrator 
account, postgres. Use the following sudo command to change from your normal 
user to the postgres account.

----
$ sudo su - postgres
----

Creating a user account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wish to use an existing user account you can skip this step.

Once you have access to the database, you can create user accounts 
with the createuser command. It will prompt for a password for the 
new user and ask some details on the user account. You can answer 'n' to all.

For example, to create a user called QVDUser you would use the following command.

----
postgres@myserver:~$ createuser -P QVDUser
Enter password for new role: passw0rd
Enter it again: passw0rd
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
----

The new user can now be assigned as the owner of a database. First we
need to create the QVD database.

Creating the QVD database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the createdb command to create a database for QVD. Use the -O switch 
to set the database's owner to the account you wish to use. In this case
we will set the owner to the new user that we created in the previous step.

----
postgres@myserver:~$ createdb -O QVDUser QVDDatabase
----

Changing PostgreSQL configuration·
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a production environment where multiple systems interact with the
QVD Database, QVD uses transactions extensively, and requires a higher level of transaction 
isolation than is configured by default. Furthermore, you would
generally want PostgreSQL to be accessible to other hosts on your
network. While this step is optional in the standalone solution that
we are creating in this guide, you might want to configure these
settings to ensure that your system is ready to handle additional
QVD Server Nodes. To do this you must edit the PostgreSQL 
configuration file `postgresql.conf`. On Ubuntu they are located 
in `/etc/postgresql/8.4/main`.

The transaction isolation level is controlled with the default_transaction_isolation 
setting. To enable network access to PostgreSQL in general, change the listen_addresses 
setting from 'localhost' to '*'.

----
root@myserver:~# cd /etc/postgresql/8.4/main
root@myserver:/etc/postgresql/8.4/main# vi postgresql.conf
listen_addresses = '*'
default_transaction_isolation = 'serializable'
----

IMPORTANT: While the previous step was optional for a standalone
configuration, the following step is not. You will need to configure
network access for the QVD user that you have created.

To enable network access for the user qvd, add the following line to
`/etc/postgresql/8.4/main/pg_hba.conf` (its 
format follows: host database user CIDR-address auth-method [auth-options]).

----
root@myserver:/etc/postgresql/8.4/main# vi pg_hba.conf
host  QVDDatabase QVDUser 192.168.0.0/24  md5
----

NOTE: Make sure to replace the default network 192.168.0.0/24 with the network that your 
QVD platform uses.

Restart PostgreSQL for the changes to take effect.
----
root@myserver:~# /etc/init.d/postgresql-8.4 restart
----

Installing the QVD tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now time to populate the database with the tables that will be used to hold data
for QVD. Before we can use any of the QVD tools, we will need to configure the database, 
user name and password in the QVD configuration files.

Once done, execute qvd-deploy-db.pl. It creates the table structure that QVD needs.
----
# qvd-deploy-db.pl
----

Testing access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following command lists the tables used by QVD.
----
anyuser@otherserver:~$ psql -U QVDUser -W -h myserver
Password for user qvd:·
psql (8.4.1, server 8.3.10)

It is now time to install the QVD Server. To do this, ensure that you
have root privileges.

----
root@myserver:~# apt-get install qvd-node
----

This will install all of the QVD server utilities, as well as all of
the dependencies required to run a QVD Node.

It is also worthwhile installing the QVD CLI Administration utility at
this point to help with some of the steps that you will perform during
this phase of the setup process. The QVD CLI Administration utility is
included as a dependency for the *qvd-db* package, so more than likely
you will already have it installed. Nonetheless, it is possible that
you have decided to install the different components on different
hosts, so for the sake of completeness, you can install this utility
using the following command:

----
root@myserver:~# apt-get install qvd-admin
----

This useful tool permits scripting all the operations that can be performed 
using the web administration tool in the *qvd-wat* package. You can
install it on any host that you want to use to manage your QVD Server.
For instance, you may want to integrate QVD with an external
monitoring tool such as Nagios, so installing the QVD CLI
Administration utility on this host would make this possible.

The QVD Administration utility requires access to the QVD Node
configuration file in order to function properly. We will set this up
in the next step, but it is worth keeping in mind that if you want to
install this utility on any other host, you should copy the QVD Node
configuration file to the host where you intend to run the tool.

Base Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you have finished installing the packages, you will need to
create a node configuration file. The easiest way to do this is to
copy the template configuration to your /etc directory:

----
root@myserver:~# cp -R /usr/share/qvd/config /etc/qvd
----

Now you will need to edit the file `/etc/qvd/node.conf` to include the
details needed to access the database. If you have been following
these instructions closely, your configuration file should look like
this:

----
# 
# QVD Node Configuration
#

# Name of this node in QVD. Usually the machine's hostname.
nodename = mycomputer

# Database connection information.
# database.host: where the QVD database is found
# database.name: the name of the QVD database
# database.user: the user account needed to connect
# database.password: the password needed to connect
database.host = mycomputer
database.name = QVDDatabase
database.user = QVDUser
database.password = passw0rd

----

First, the `nodename` entry and the `database.host` entry should match your 
machine's hostname, so the example above does need some editing.

The database host should also match the hostname or IP address for the
system where your database is located. By default the database name is
usually set to 'QVDDatabase' but for customized installs, this may be
different. You will also need to set the database username and
password, which you configured when you set up the database.

Setting Internal QVD Configuration Parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While it is possible to add other configuration parameters to the
QVD Node Configuration file that we edited above, this file is simply
used to bootstrap the server and thereafter the server will refer to
the database to find any other configuration entries, so it is better
practice to set QVD configuration parameters within the database.

There are some parameters that must be defined in order to tell
QVD about its environment (for instance, the range of IPs available
for the virtual machines or their default gateway). These parameters
are mandatory and the QVD daemons will refuse to start unless they are
defined. They are as follows:

* `vm.network.ip.start`: first IP of the range allocated for the virtual
  machines on the bus network

* `vm.network.netmask`: size in bits on the bus network address

* `vm.network.gateway`: IP of the firewall on the bus network that
  will be passed by DHCP to the virtual machines

* `vm.network.bridge`: Name of the bridge interface

These entries can be set on the database using the command `qvd-admin.pl`
available from the `qvd-admin` package as follows:

----
# qvd-admin.pl config set vm.network.ip.start=10.1.0.50
# qvd-admin.pl config set vm.network.netmask=16
# qvd-admin.pl config set vm.network.gateway=10.1.0.1
# qvd-admin.pl config set vm.network.bridge=qvdnet0
----

You can also use this tool to set the QVD-WAT username and password:

----
# qvd-admin.pl config set wat.admin.login = admin
# qvd-admin.pl config set wat.admin.password = admin
----

Configuring network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Getting your network configuration right is one of the most important
steps to getting QVD running properly. In order to be successful you
need to prepare you system to run the QVD Server. If you follow the
steps in this section carefully, you should not run into any trouble.

Set dnsmasq to be controlled by QVD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

QVD uses dnsmasq as a DHCP and DNS server for the virtual machines
that run in a node. In order to function correctly, dnsmasq needs to
be run by the qvd-node process. By default, the Ubuntu package starts
the process running as a daemon in the background, so you need to stop 
it from starting automatically. This is done with the following commands.

----
# /etc/init.d/dnsmasq stop
# sed -i s/ENABLED=1/ENABLED=0/ /etc/default/dnsmasq
----

Configure IP forwarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next up, we need to make sure that your system is capable of handling
the IP forwarding in order to route clients to the correct location.
You can do this quickly by running the following command.

----
# echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
----

Unfortunately, when you reboot you host system, this change will be
lost. To make it permanent, you can edit `/etc/sysctl.conf` and
uncomment the line:

----
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
----

You can force sysctl to reload its settings after you have edited this
file by running:

----
# sysctl -p
----

Configure a Network Bridge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are a number of ways to go about configuring your network bridge
and the appropriate routing to make sure that a QVD client is routed
to the correct virtual machine.

The easiest method is to set up a static network interface and to
configure a set of *iptables* routing rules to perform the NAT
required to translate IP addresses between your real and virtual
network interfaces. To do this, edit the file
`/etc/network/interfaces` and add the following lines.

----
auto qvdnet0
iface qvdnet0 inet static
  pre-up brctl addbr qvdnet0
  pre-up iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o qvdnet0 -j SNAT to-source 192.168.0.2
  pre-up iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 192.168.0.2 -p tcp --dport 8443 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.1.0.1
  post-down brctl delbr qvdnet0
  address 10.1.0.1
  netmask 255.255.0.0
  network 10.1.0.0
----

It is important to note that in the above example you will need to
change the IP address *192.168.0.2* to the IP address of the network
interface that you intend your clients to connect to.

While there are other cleaner approaches to setting up your network,
these sometimes run into problems with particular network interfaces
such as WIFI. The approach listed above should work for most systems.

Once you have written the network configuration to file, you should
bring up the network bridge interface.

----
# ifup qvdnet0
----

Configuring SSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The QVD server needs an x509 certificate and private key for securing
network connections. For a production installation you should use a
certificate issued by a recognized certificate authority, such as
Verisign or Thawte. For testing purposes you can use a self-signed
certificate. In this demonstration, we will step through creating a
self-signed certificate, and use this within our configuration. If you
already have a certificate signed by a third party, you can skip this
step and use your signed certificate instead.

Creating a self-signed certificate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The openssl tool is required for creating a self-signed certificate.
If you have not already installed it you can do so using the Ubuntu
repositories:

----
# apt-get install openssl
----

We recommend that for working with your certificates, you create a
subdirectory in `/etc/qvd`.

----
# mkdir /etc/qvd/certs
# cd /etc/qvd/certs
----

In order to create your certificate, you must first generate a private key.

----
# openssl genrsa 1024 > server-private-key.pem
----

Given the private key, a self-signed certificate is created with the
following command.

----
# openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 60 -key server-private-key.pem > server-certificate.pem
----

OpenSSL will prompt you to enter the various fields that it requires
for the certificate. You should enter relevant information into these
fields. The most important field is the *Common Name* field which
should match the fully qualified domain name of the host that will be
running your QVD node.

----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be
incorporated into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or
a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
+++-----+++
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:ES
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:Madrid
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Madrid
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Qindel Group·
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:QVD Team
Common Name (eg, YOUR name) []:qvd.qindel.com
Email Address []:qvd@qindel.com
----

You will now have a self signed certificate and its corresponding
private key.

Configure QVD to use the SSL Certificates
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the previous step we created a directory `/etc/qvd/certs` to store
our self-signed certificate. If you are using a certificate signed by
a recognized CA, you may want to put your certificates into the same
place in order for the following instructions to make sense.

In this step, we will configure QVD to make use of the server
certificate and private key. To do this, we will use the qvd-admin
tool.

----
# qvd-admin.pl config ssl key=/etc/qvd/certs/server-private-key.pem cert=/etc/qvd/certs/server-certificate.pem
----

If the certificate isn't signed by a trusted authority, it has to be
added to the system's trusted certificates directory so that the SSL
layer can validate it. To work out what that directory is, run the
following command:

----
# openssl version -d
----

The trusted certificates directory is always a subdirectory named
*certs* within the directory returned by the above command.

For example, the command may return the following response:

----
OPENSSLDIR: "/usr/lib/ssl"
----

This would indicate that the your trusted certificates are stored in
`/usr/lib/ssl/certs`. In most cases this is actually a symlink to
somewhere else, but this path should be sufficient to work with.

In order for SSL to recognize the certificate, it needs to be named
correctly. The following commands will help you to ensure that the
certificate is named correctly.

----
# trusted_ssl_path=/usr/lib/ssl/certs
# cert_path=/etc/qvd/certs/server-certificate.pem
# cert_name=`openssl x509 -noout -hash -in $cert_path`.0
# cp $cert_path $trusted_ssl_path/QVD-L7R-cert.pem
# ln -s $trusted_ssl_path/QVD-L7R-cert.pem $trusted_ssl_path/$cert_name
----

You will need to correct the *trusted_ssl_path* and the *cert_path* in
the commands listed above to match your environment. The commands
listed above will first ensure that we get the correct name for your
certificate, and then will copy the certificate to the path where your
trusted certificates should be stored, renaming it to
'QVD-L7R-cert.pem' so that it has a name that you will be able to make
sense of later. Finally, we create a symlink from the certificate to
the name that OpenSSL expects in order to use the certificate file.

Installing and Configuring QVD-WAT
----------------------------------

The QVD Web Administration Tool (QVD-WAT) is a simple interface that
makes it easier to administer and manage your QVD Server Nodes and to
monitor active client sessions within your infrastructure. It also
gives you the ability to manage QVD Server nodes from remote
locations.

Although not strictly required to run QVD, it will certainly help you
to get started with the product, so we will install it and configure
our server node using this facility.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install the package with apt-get:

----
# apt-get install qvd-wat
----

QVD-WAT makes use of the database connection details within the QVD
Node configuration file at `/etc/qvd/node.conf`. Since we are
installing all of the components on a single host, the existing file
should not need to be edited. However, if you have opted to install
each component on a different host, you could copy the configuration
file from your QVD Server Node host to the host that you are using to
run QVD-WAT.

CAUTION: At the moment QVD works only with libcatalyst-perl version 5.80024-1. 
These are the default versions currently provided with Ubuntu 10.04
(Lucid Lynx). If you are using a newer distribution, you may need to
downgrade this package.

Running
~~~~~~~
[[QVD-WAT-Running]]

The Web Administration Tool is started with the following command.

----
# /etc/init.d/qvd-wat start
----

Now you can test the connection in your browser, visiting
http://localhost:3000 

To login, you can use the default username and password:

* *username*: admin
* *password*: admin

After that, you should change the default password using:

----
# qvd-admin.pl config set wat.admin.password=newpassword
----

The QVD-WAT user is independent of QVD user management. This user is 
unique to QVD-WAT within the solution, so you can choose any password
you prefer.

You will need to restart QVD-WAT to apply the change.
----
# /etc/init.d/qvd-wat restart
----

Add Your QVD Server Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you are able to connect to QVD-WAT, you will need to register
the QVD Node Server that you have configured as a node within the QVD
infrastructure. To do this, you can click on the *Nodes* link at the
top of the page, or go to http://localhost:3000/hosts/.

TIP: If you installed the <<qvd_metapackage,QVD Demo Metapackage>>, you do not need to
follow this step, as the metapackage automatically adds the details
for the Server Node that it sets up directly into the QVD database.

.The Node link in the QVD-WAT Navigation bar
image::../images/WAT_newnode1.png[alt="The Node link in the QVD-WAT Navigation bar"]

Click on the *New* button and you will be presented with a screen that
looks like this:

.Adding a New QVD Server Node in the QVD-WAT
image::../images/WAT_newnode.png[alt="Adding a New QVD Server Node in the QVD-WAT" width=98%]

Enter the *Name* of the host node that you are adding, usually the
hostname is a good option.

Also enter the *IP address* of the host that is running your QVD Server.
This should be the externally facing IP address that you expect client
applications to connect to.

Finally, click on the 'addhost' button to save the information that
you have just entered.

Installing Your First Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order for QVD to serve a desktop to a user, you will need to create an OSF
(Operating System Flavour) and assign a DI (Disk Image) to it. The OSF allows 
you to provide different users with different operating systems, or simply to 
provide different applications or environments to users with different requirements. 
As already mentioned, the image is loaded into its own virtual machine
for each user that connects to the server. This means that you can
have one image that is used to serve multiple users. On the other
hand, you can install as many images as you require, so that in a
'worst case' scenario you have a different image for each user.


Download a demonstration Disk Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Since we just want a quick method to get started, we are not going to
go to the trouble of creating our own image. Instead, we will simply
download a DI (Disk Image) from the QVD website. You can download the image
from the following link:

http://theqvd.com/download

Once you have finished downloading the image file, you will need to
move it to a location that can be used by the QVD-WAT. Toward the
beginning of this document, we mentioned that QVD makes use of a
number of common storage directories. In particular, the directory
located at `/var/lib/qvd/storage/staging` is used by the QVD-WAT as a
temporary directory to store image files that will eventually be used
by QVD Server Nodes to load into a virtual machine. Therefore, you
should move the image file that you have downloaded into this
directory:

----
# mv qvd-demo.img /var/lib/qvd/storage/staging
----

Load the image into QVD
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Now you need to load the image that you have downloaded into QVD and
set the amount of memory that you want the virtual machine to make
available to the image. To that end, you need to create an OSF and
then assign a DI to it.

In QVD-WAT, click on the *OS Flavours* link in the navigation bar, or go to
http://localhost:3000/osf/.

.The OS Flavours link in the QVD-WAT Navigation bar
image::../images/WAT_newosf1.png[alt="The OS Flavours link in the QVD-WAT Navigation bar"]

Now click on the *New* button to add an operating system. You will be presented
with the following screen.

.Adding an OS Flavour to QVD using the QVD-WAT
image::../images/WAT_newosf.png[alt="Adding an OS Flavour to QVD using the QVD-WAT" width=98%]

In the *Name* field, provide a name for the OSF. Usually you would
name an OSF providing some indication of its purpose. So something
like 'AccountingUsers' might make sense if the OSF is going to be
used to provision applications used only by Accounting staff members.

The *Memory* field is used to allocate system memory to the Operating
System. It has a default setting of 256 MB. This field is not
compulsory unless you want to change the default value to suit the
image better. For evaluation purposes, the default value should be
more than sufficient, so you can leave this field blank. However, on
production systems, you may want to increase this to at least 512 MB
for the Gnome or KDE desktop environment to run comfortably.

The *User space* field is used to allocate disk space to a user for
the purpose of storing a home directory. By default, this option is
usually not set. This means that a user's home directory should either
be mounted using a network fileshare within the OSF, or the home
directory will not be persistent. Setting a value here will create a 
virtual disk of the size specified. This helps to enforce quotas and to 
prevent user home directories from being accessible to each other across 
Virtual Machines. For evaluation purposes, you can leave this field
blank, but remember that any data that you create within your virtual
desktop will only be available for as long as the virtual machine is
runnning. If you restart the virtual machine, the home directory will
be lost and it will be reset to its original state. If you want to
store data for your home directory, you can set this to an acceptable
size. For demonstration purposes, you should set it to 1024 MB,
providing your user with around one gigabyte of disk space to work
with.

Now to create the DI, in QVD-WAT, click on the *Disk Images* link in the navigation bar, or go to
http://localhost:3000/di/.

.The Disk Images link in the QVD-WAT Navigation bar
image::../images/WAT_newimage1.png[alt="The Disk Images link in the QVD-WAT Navigation bar"]

Now click on the *New* button to add an image. You will be presented
with the following screen.

.Adding an Image to QVD using the QVD-WAT
image::../images/WAT_newimage.png[alt="Adding an Image to QVD using the QVD-WAT" width=98%]

The newly created OSF will appear in the *OS Flavour* selection box.
Select it by clicking on it.

If you have moved your image file into `/var/lib/qvd/storage/staging`
you will see it listed in the *Image file* selection box. Click on it to
select it as the image that you want to use.

Finally, there is a checkbox that allows you to *Delete after action*.
This option is available because the original image file is copied to
`/var/lib/qvd/storage/images` once you have loaded it into QVD. You
may want to delete the image file from the staging directory to save
disk space, but you may equally want to reuse it with alternative
memory and user space settings for another group of users. It is
optional to delete the temporary image file, but during evaluation we
recommend that you keep it unless disk space is at a premium.

Click on the *Create* button to load the image.

Adding Your First User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you click on the *Users* link in the navigation bar, or go to
http://localhost:3000/users/, you are able to add new users to QVD and
manage any existing users. At this point, you will have no users
listed. It is time to add a new user.

.The Users link in the QVD-WAT Navigation bar
image::../images/WAT_newuser1.png[alt="The Users link in the QVD-WAT Navigation bar"]

Click on the *New* button to add a user. You will be presented with
the following screen:

.Adding a User in the QVD-WAT
image::../images/WAT_newuser.png[alt="Adding a User in the QVD-WAT" width=98%]

Enter a *Login* name for the user. This should be a standard Linux
username, usually in lowercase and with no spaces or reserved
characters. For the purpose of this guide, we suggest you enter a
username like 'qvddemo'.

Enter a *Password* for the user. This should be a normal Linux
password, although there are no limitations on length. In the spirit
of reasonably good security, we recommend that the password is at
least 6 characters long and contains uppercase, lowercase and
numerical characters. Something like '54ghFe9' would be a sensible
choice.

You will need to re-enter the password in the *Confirm Password*
field.

Click on the *Submit* button to create your user.

Attaching a Virtual Machine To A User
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you have added a user, you will return to the Users screen in the
QVD-WAT and you will see your user listed here. The user will have
been allocated an ID. If it is your first user, this will more than
likely be '1'. You will notice that this ID is also a link, and a
magnifying glass icon is displayed alongside it.

.After Adding a User in the QVD-WAT
image::../images/WAT_newuseradded_gsg.png[alt="After Adding a User in the QVD-WAT" width=98%]

If you click on the ID link or magnifying glass icon, you will be
taken to a new screen where you are able to assign a Virtual Machine
to a user, or change the User's password. 

.Editing a User in the QVD-WAT to Attach a Virtual Machine
image::../images/WAT_edituser_gsg.png[alt="Editing a User in the QVD-WAT to Attach a Virtual Machine" width=98%]

At this point, there are no Virtual Machines set up within QVD. We can 
add a new Virtual Machine and assign it directly to the current user 
from this page. Click on the *New Virtual Machine* link.

.The New Virtual Machine link
image::../images/WAT_newvmlink_gsg.png[alt="The New Virtual Machine link"]

You will arrive at a screen that looks like this:

.Adding a Virtual Machine to a User in the QVD-WAT
image::../images/WAT_newvm_gsg.png[alt="Adding a Virtual Machine to a User in the QVD-WAT" width=98%]

Here, you only need to provide a name for the Virtual Machine
instance, and select the image that should be loaded into the Virtual
Machine.

In the *Name* field, enter a useful name for the Virtual Machine.
Usually something like a combination of the Username and the Image
name would make sense here. So something like 'QVDUser-Accounting'.

Now simply double click on the Image that you wish to load into this
Virtual Machine.

If everything behaves correctly, this should bring you to a page that
looks like this:

.The Virtual Machine added to a User in the QVD-WAT
image::../images/WAT_newvm1_gsg.png[alt="The Virtual Machine added to a User in the QVD-WAT" width=98%]

This page is also accessible by clicking on the *Virtual machines*
link in the navigation bar, or by going to http://localhost:3000/vm/.

From this page, it is possible to see the status and manage any Virtual
Machine within QVD. At this point, we want to see QVD in action, so we
will not spend any more time discussing the options available here.

Simply check the checkbox next to the listed Virtual Machine and then
click on Start. After a minute or two, you should see the Virtual
Machine 'State' change through various phases of the boot process. If
everything goes well, you should eventually see that the 'State'
changes to 'running'.

.The Virtual Machine has started and is running
image::../images/WAT_newvm2_gsg.png[alt="The Virtual Machine has started and is running" width=98%]

From this point, you should be able to connect to QVD using a client
and connecting as the user that you have just created.

Installing and Configuring QVD Client
-------------------------------------

The QVD client is available for both Linux and Microsoft Windows
platforms. Certainly, we recommend that for more seamless integration
you should consider running the client on a Linux platform. However,
it is quite possible that you have users that make use of both
environments and would like to run a virtualized Linux desktop from
within Windows.

Whatever your choice of platform to run the client application, it is
best that you run it on a different system to the one that you are
using to run server side components. This will give you a much better
picture of how the whole environment works.

Downloading and Installing the Windows Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using Microsoft Windows as your base platform to run the
QVD Client application, you will need to download the QVD Client
installer manually. You can download the installer from:

http://qvd.qindel.com/qvd3/windows/qvd-client-3.0.0-1-setup.exe

Once you have finished downloading the installer, run it as a normal
executable file and follow the wizard through the installation
process.

.The Windows QVD Client Installer Wizard
image::../images/Windows_ClientInstaller1.png[alt="The Windows QVD Client Installer Wizard"]

Once you have finished the installation, you can either run the client
from the shortcut on your Windows desktop (if you selected to add the
shortcut) or from the QVD menu in your Applications menu. This will
open the client so that you are ready to connect.

.The Windows QVD Client
image::../images/Windows_Client.png[alt="The Windows QVD Client"]


Downloading and Installing the Ubuntu Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installing the QVD Client on an Ubuntu Linux platform is simple. You
should add the QVD repository to your apt repository sources. Run the
following commands as root:

----
# echo 'deb http://qvd.qindel.com/debian lucid main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list
# apt-get update
----

You will now be able to install the client with the following command.

----
sudo apt-get install qvd-client
----

Depending on your Desktop Environment, you should be able to access
the client within your 'Applications' menu, usually under the
'Internet' submenu. Alternatively, you can run the client GUI from the
console using the command `qvd-gui-client.pl`.

Connecting to your Virtual Desktop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once you have the GUI client running, you can enter the *Username* for
the user that you created in QVD, the *Password* that you configured
for the user, the *Server* hostname or IP address for the QVD Server
Node that you created, and you can choose the level of compression for
the connection by selecting a *Connection type*.

.Enter the details for your QVD connection
image::../images/GUI_login.png[alt="Enter the details for your QVD connection"]

By default, the *Connection type* is set to 'Local'. This setting is
appropriate for connections over a local area network. There are also
options for 'ADSL', which would be appropriate for any broadband
connection, and for 'Modem' which can be used in cases where bandwidth
is severely limited or impaired.

Changing the *Connection type* will increase the compression used to
deliver the virtual desktop across your network connection. It also
increases the amount of caching that the client performs to limit the
amount of screen refreshing that needs to take place.

In general, using heavy compression and caching will still afford your
users the ability to work comfortably within their virtual desktops.
However the quality of graphical rendering will be a little inferior.

Once you have completed entering your connection details, simply click
on the button labelled *Connect* and your virtual desktop should load.

Additional Notes about Server Side Administration
--------------------------------------------------
At this point, you should have a functional installation of all of the
QVD Server Side components. If you connect to the server with a
client, you will be able to access your virtual desktop. Nonetheless,
you may still have some other questions. This section is here to help
provide you with some answers and some pointers toward documentation 
that may help you to resolve any additional requirements.

Creating Your Own Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this guide, we took advantage of a pre-built image and simply
loaded it into QVD. At this point, you are more than likely asking
yourself whether you can create your own images. The answer is a
resounding 'Yes!'. We provided an image so that you could get started
very quickly to evaluate our product.

The steps to create your own image are relatively easy to follow and
are documented fully in the _QVD Administration Manual_ in the chapter
titled 'DI Creation'.

An OSF needs to run the QVD Virtual Machine Agent (QVD-VMA).
Currently, QVD has packages for Ubuntu and SUSE Linux. However, the
QVD-VMA is simply a perl script that can run on any Operating System
that supports Perl and that can run an NX Server. This means that you
can create an OSF for any Linux distribution or for Solaris.

Making Changes To An Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're happy with the current image, or you have already created
your own, you may want to know how you can edit this image to include
different applications, or to change behaviours within the image. If
you have already tried to do anything like this connected to your
virtual desktop using the client application you will have realized
that changes within the base operating system image are not
persistent. That is, when you restart the image, any changes are lost.

This is actually one of QVD's strengths. It helps to protect all of
your users from damaging changes and ensures that if any desktop is
compromised the damage only lasts for as long as the desktop is
running.

However, it is possible to change an image and to install new
applications. In order to do this, you effectively run the image in a
different mode. This will allow you to make changes to the underlying
image file, so that when it is reloaded all users who access the same
image will see the changes.

The ability to switch modes so that you can edit your OSF is available
within the QVD-WAT. The process for editing an image is fully
documented in the _QVD Administration Manual_ in the chapter titled
'Editing a DI'.

Authenticating Users Against LDAP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You may already have your own authentication infrastructure in place,
particularly if your organization makes heavy use of Microsoft Windows
and Active Directory, or if you use some other LDAP service to manage
your users. In this guide, users were created within the QVD-WAT and
added into the PostgreSQL database. However, it is relatively trivial
to point QVD at an LDAP resource to handle the authentication of
users.

This is controlled by configuration keys in the QVD database that can 
be changed using the CLI Administration Tool. 

For example, to set up authentication against an LDAP server that runs on 
the machine aguila on the port 3389 with search base dc=example,dc=com you 
would execute the following command:

----
# qvd-admin.pl config set l7r.auth.mode=ldap l7r.auth.ldap.host=aguila:3389 l7r.auth.ldap.base=dc=example,dc=com
----

When a client attempts to authenticate, the QVD Server Node will
connect to the LDAP Host and perform a search for the user with the
'uid' attribute matching the provided username. The LDAP search is
performed with a default scope of 'base'. Once a match is found, a
typical BIND request is performed for the user and if successful, the
user is authenticated.

It is possible to change the default values for the scope and filter
used in the LDAP search, to match your environment. For instance, you
might do the following using the CLI Administration Tool:

----
# qvd-admin.pl config set l7r.auth.ldap.filter=(cn=%u) l7r.auth.ldap.scope=sub
----

Currently, you still need to add all of your users within the WAT,
since you will need to assign the users each to a virtual machine.
However, this facility will simply ensure that users are authenticated
against your LDAP repository.

It is possible to automate the provisioning of users and virtual
machines from LDAP to QVD and there are tools available to do this,
but they are not released with the Open Source Edition of the
software. Further details are available within the _QVD Administration
Manual_.

Managing A Virtual Machine As An Administrator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a Virtual Machine doesn't start properly or you need to access it
directly as an Administrator, QVD provides a virtual console, SSH
access and can even offer VNC access to a virtual machine.

For situations where a virtual machine doesn't start, it will more
than likely be shut down and will enter a 'blocked' state so that
clients are unable to connect to it. An Administrator is able to
'unblock' a virtual machine and restart it. Using telnet, the
Administrator can then view the boot process as if at a serial
console. If the machine manages to get past the boot phase and
networking is loaded correctly, the Administrator can use SSH to
access a terminal within the virtual machine.

These topics are fairly advanced and are covered in much more detail
within our _QVD Administration Manual_.

Using LXC Virtualization instead of KVM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This Getting Started Guide is mainly focussed on demonstrating how easily
you can provide Virtual Desktops to end users by using the KVM hypervisor
within the QVD infrastructure. For environments where the base operating
system used for the desktop platform will essentially be the same as the 
host operating system, you may be able to benefit from improved performance
and resource management by taking advantage of LXC technology in conjunction
with QVD.

As of QVD 3.1, the KVM hypervisor can be disabled and virtualization can
be achieved using LXC. Since there are various complexities to setting up
an LXC environment at this stage within QVD's development, instructions for
achieving a basic LXC configuration have been omitted from this document.
If you are interested in setting up LXC, please refer to the chapter on
'Using LXC Virtualization in QVD' in our _QVD Administration Manual_.

Conclusion
----------
In this guide, we have stepped through a basic installation and
configuration of all of the components within a QVD solution.
Hopefully, by following the guide you have managed to get your own
virtual desktop solution running and have been able to connect to it
using a QVD client.

QVD can be used for a wide range of purposes and scales incredibly
well, making it the first choice for a desktop virtualization platform
within the enterprise. Its remote management facilities, its ease of
integration with other technologies and its ability to service remote
users in a safe and secure manner will help you to improve the
management of your Linux and Solaris users and to reduce the costs
associated with desktop virtualization.

We hope that this demonstration has helped you to get started with QVD
and that you will continue to explore its capabilities in the future.
