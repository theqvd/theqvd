Setup
-----

Installing lxc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just install the package +lxc+ as root (this file documents usage with version 0.7.4):

----
# apt-get install lxc
----

(*UPDATE*: lxc has been installed in the test1 box from ~qvd/lxc-0.7.4.tar.gz)

Then check that the needed kernel compilation options are in place:

----
$ lxc-checkconfig 
Kernel config /proc/config.gz not found, looking in other places...
Found kernel config file /boot/config-2.6.35-22-server
--- Namespaces ---
Namespaces: enabled
Utsname namespace: enabled
Ipc namespace: enabled
Pid namespace: enabled
User namespace: enabled
Network namespace: enabled
Multiple /dev/pts instances: enabled

--- Control groups ---
Cgroup: enabled
Cgroup namespace: enabled
Cgroup device: enabled
Cgroup sched: enabled
Cgroup cpu account: enabled
Cgroup memory controller: enabled
Cgroup cpuset: enabled

--- Misc ---
Veth pair device: enabled
Macvlan: enabled
Vlan: enabled
File capabilities: enabled
----

If the output doesn't look like this, you'll have to recompile your kernel.

Setting up a network bridge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, we replace eth1, which has IP 10.1.0.101, with a bridge:

----
#auto eth1
#iface eth1 inet static
# ...

auto qvdnet0
iface qvdnet0 inet static
    address 10.1.0.101
    netmask 255.255.255.0
    gateway 10.1.0.1
    bridge_ports eth1
    bridge_stp off
    bridge_fd 0
    bridge_maxwait 0
----

Creating a new container
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

General layout
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
----
/somewhere
  \_ container.conf
  \_ nfsroot/
  \_ overlay1.ext4
  \_ overlay2.ext4
  \_ ...
  \_ run-cont.sh
----

+nfsroot+ is a directory where, in our setup, the root directory for all the
containers is to be mounted read-only from a remote NFS server. The script
+run-cont.sh+ takes care of that. The overlay images can be created with the
following:

----
dd if=/dev/null of=overlay99.ext4 bs=1 seek=5G
mkfs.ext4 -F overlay99.ext4
----

but +run-cont.sh+ already does that when needed, too.

----

  - +lxc.pivotdir+ specifies the directory for the +pivot_root(2)+ system call.
    Since the root filesystem is mounted readonly, we can't let +lxc-start+
    choose and create a temporary directory for this operation.
  - +lxc.network.type+ introduces a new network interface inside the container.
    Everytime it appears in the configuration, a new interface is configured.
  - +lxc.network.link+ refers to the bridge we just configured earlier.
  - +lxc.network.name+ is the name that this network interface will have inside
    the container. Can be virtually any string.
  - +lxc.mount.entry+ specifies a fstab-like line to mount a resource before
    bringing up the container.
  - +lxc.mount+ specifies a file in which those fstab-like lines can be put,
    instead of having them inlined in this LXC configuration file.
  - +lxc.cgroup.cpu.shares+ changes the amount of CPU time that this container
    can use. The default value is 1024, so saying eg. 512 will give this container
    half as much CPU time as the other ones.

Any directive can be specified at the +lxc-start+ command line (using the +-s+
parameter), making the configuration file effectively optional (but in that
case the command line would be very long, of course).

+run-cont.sh+
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This is a script I (dserrano) am currently using to start containers. It mounts
NFS if needed, creates the overlay if needed, picks both MAC and IP addresses,
union-mounts some directories, starts the container and waits for it to stop so
as to undo the union-mount operations and do some clean up.

----

Since +CAP_SYS_ADMIN+ is dropped inside the container, all the +mount(2)+
operations have to be performed from the outside, and that's why they are
specified in the +lxc-start+ command line.

Modifications to the container filesystem
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+/dev+
^^^^^^
Only the minimum set of devices should exist under +/dev+. The daemon +udev+
doesn't work under LXC, so the +/dev+ management has to be done by hand.
Following is a set of shell commands needed to create these devices. They
assume that the root filesystem path is specified by the shell variable
+$ROOTFS+, *make sure* this is the case, or the system's +/dev+ will be wiped
clean!

----
echo $ROOTFS
rm -rf $ROOTFS/dev
mkdir $ROOTFS/dev
mkdir -m 755 $ROOTFS/dev/pts
mkdir -m 1777 $ROOTFS/dev/shm 
mknod -m 600 $ROOTFS/dev/console c 5 1
mknod -m 666 $ROOTFS/dev/full c 1 7
mknod -m 600 $ROOTFS/dev/initctl p
mknod -m 666 $ROOTFS/dev/null c 1 3 
mknod -m 666 $ROOTFS/dev/ptmx c 5 2
mknod -m 666 $ROOTFS/dev/random c 1 8
mknod -m 666 $ROOTFS/dev/tty c 5 0
mknod -m 666 $ROOTFS/dev/tty0 c 4 0
mknod -m 666 $ROOTFS/dev/tty1 c 4 1
mknod -m 666 $ROOTFS/dev/tty2 c 4 2
mknod -m 666 $ROOTFS/dev/tty3 c 4 3
mknod -m 666 $ROOTFS/dev/tty4 c 4 4
mknod -m 666 $ROOTFS/dev/urandom c 1 9
mknod -m 666 $ROOTFS/dev/zero c 1 5
----

+/etc/hosts+
^^^^^^^^^^^^
It needs to be modified to list the special host __HOSTNAME__ where the actual
hostname is needed. Later, the init scripts will change that into the real
hostname received from +lxc-start+.

+/etc/fstab+
^^^^^^^^^^^^
In theory this could be empty, since the default mount points are handled from
+run-cont.sh+. Nevertheless, if we want to use DHCP, then a bogus line +none /
auto ro 0 0+ is required so that +/sbin/dhclient-script+ detects that the root
filesystem is read-only, preventing it from trying to rewrite
+/etc/resolv.conf+.

init scripts (+/etc/init+ in Ubuntu)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Most init scripts should be removed since they deal with daemons not needed (or
even inconvenient) inside a container. For example, everything hardware-related
(ACPI, ALSA, avahi, clock, IRQs, udev) must be moved out of the way. What I did
is place them in +$ROOTFS/etc/init.moved+ instead of deleting them. This is
what was left:

----
anacron.conf
atd.conf
cron.conf
dbus.conf          (needed for the power-off button in the GNOME panel)
dmesg.conf
networking.conf    (not needed if DHCP isn't used, since the network can be configured beforehand via lxc-start)
rc.conf
rc-sysinit.conf
rsyslog.conf
ssh.conf
tty1.conf
tty2.conf
tty3.conf
ufw.conf
----

Regarding the basic rcS scripts, we don't have +/etc/init/rcS+, but
+rc-sysinit.conf+ calls +/etc/init.d/rcS+, which runs all scripts under
+/etc/rcS.d+. This directory only needs two files: +S70screen-cleanup+ (useful
is GNU screen is used, harmless otherwise) and +S70x11-common+ (*required*, it
creates +/tmp/.X11-unix+) — the rest can be removed.

Another thing worth mentioning is +ttyS0.conf+. Since it deals directly with
the hardware, it shouldn't run inside a container.

After the cleanup, create a small script, +lxc.conf+, with these contents:

----
# LXC - Fix init sequence to have LXC containers boot with upstart

# description “Fix LXC container - Lucid”

start on startup

task
pre-start script
    H=$(hostname)
    sed -i -e "s/__HOSTNAME__/$H/" /etc/hosts
    find /var/run -xdev ! -path /var/run -delete
    mkdir -p /var/run/network
    touch /var/run/utmp
    chmod 664 /var/run/utmp
    chown root.utmp /var/run/utmp
    if [ "$(find /etc/network/ -name upstart -type f)" ]; then
        chmod -x /etc/network/*/upstart || true
    fi
    #route add default gw 10.1.0.1      ## uncomment if DHCP isn't used and the network is configured via lxc-start
end script

script
    start networking                    ##   comment if DHCP isn't used and the network is configured via lxc-start
    #initctl emit networking --no-wait  ## uncomment if DHCP isn't used and the network is configured via lxc-start
    initctl emit filesystem --no-wait
    initctl emit local-filesystems --no-wait
    initctl emit virtual-filesystems --no-wait
    init 2
end script
----

(TODO: I guess the pre-start script could be dealt with elsewhere - dserrano)

Last, the script +rc-sysinit.conf+ must be modified to run after system startup
event, instead of waiting to the filesystem event. Modify the line that begins
with "start on" so it reads like:

----
start on startup
----

A quick sed oneliner can do this (use at your own risk):

----
sed -i -e '/^start on/s/\(start on\) .*/\1 startup/' /tmp/rc-sysinit.conf
----


Usage
-----
  - +lxc-create+ creates the container, which isn't more than a data structure.
    This step is optional from LXC 0.7 onwards.

    lxc-create -n name -f /path/to/config-file

  - +lxc-ls+ lists the existing containers. The containers that were created
    with +lxc-create+ and are running, appear twice.

    lxc-ls

  - +lxc-start+ brings the container up.

    lxc-start -n name                           ## takes over the terminal.
    lxc-start -n name -d                        ## doesn't take over the terminal, suppresses output.
    lxc-start -n name -d -o /tmp/lxc.log        ## sends output to a log file.
    lxc-start -n name -l DEBUG ...              ## sets the log level.
    lxc-start -f config-file ...                ## LXC 0.7 and newer: allows us to skip the lxc-create step.
    lxc-start -n name -s lxc.rootfs=/some/path  ## sets a configuration directive from the command line.

  - +lxc-console+ connects to one of the container's ttys. After closing the
    session, you can get out of +lxc-console+ with the key sequence +C-A q+.

    lxc-console -n name -t 1   ## connects to tty1

  - +lxc-info+ shows brief information about the specified container.

    lxc-info -n name

  - +lxc-ps+ shows processes running inside the container.

    lxc-ps -n name
    lxc-ps --lxc

  - +lxc-stop+ kills (SIGKILL) all processes in the container, effectively stopping it.

    lxc-stop -n name

  - +lxc-destroy+ just removes the data structure. Only needed if +lxc-create+
    was used (ie. not needed after +lxc-start -f config-file+).

    lxc-destroy -n name

GNU screen
~~~~~~~~~~

From <http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=380-22010941685612722%40M2W116.mail2web.com&forum_name=lxc-users>:
----
# screen -dmS mycontainer lxc-start -n mycontainer && screen -x mycontainer

Secure Linux containers cookbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-lxc-security/>

Shutdown detection and +/var/run+ in Ubuntu containers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since some version of LXC (0.7 or 0.7.2 or so), +lxc-start+ is able to monitor
the file +/var/run/utmp+ in the container to figure out when it's being
rebooted or shut down, and take the appropriate action (restart the container's
+init+ or kill it, respectively). This is not possible in Ubuntu containers
because +/var/run+ is mounted in a +tmpfs+ by default during the boot process,
and their contents aren't visible from outside.

This is why in our setup +/var/run+ is *not* a +tmpfs+: to halt a container
it's enough to log into it and issue the +halt+ command as usual.

Kernel is not Lucid's default
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The kernel that ships with Ubuntu Lucid has a regression that causes the
+umount+ system call to take a very long time (around 300 milliseconds), which
causes big delays when starting containers. It has been upgraded from
2.6.32-24-server to 2.6.35-22-server.

+sysctl+ variables in the host
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When bringing up many containers it's easy to hit the system's default limits.
The first to appear was +fs.inotify.max_user_instances+, which has been set to
1024 (from 128 IIRC, which allowed for no more than 30 containers which didn't
run GNOME).

The kernel 2.6.35 includes additional security measures that don't seem to play
well with +aufs+: the user +qvd+ suddenly cannot rename and/or delete some
files. This has been worked around by setting the sysctl variable
+kernel.yama.protected_nonaccess_hardlinks+ to 0, thereby disabling this new
feature.
